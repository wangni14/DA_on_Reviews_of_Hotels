When we arrived, the lady at the front desk answered the phone in the middle of receiving us. She stayed on the phone for 5 minutes. The other gentleman at reception took over eventually when he was finished with his client. In my mind, you put the customer on the phone on hold if you are in the middle of serving a customer in person.\n\nSecond, at 3:20pm our room was not ready. I requested that they ensure that the room was being cleaned as check in was supposed to be at 4 pm so it was close to the deadline. At first, the gentleman said that it was not necessary, but then said he would make the call. He took our cell phone to call us when then room was ready. We waited in the lobby. After 25 minutes, my husband went to speak to the man and said that the room better be ready by 4pm and he told him that he was not impressed with the manner in which we were received with the lady taking the call in the middle of serving us. He replied that this is the hotel's policy.\n\nAt 3:55pm no one had called or come to see us. I got in line to ask the lady at reception what was going on with our room. The man was no longer at the reception desk. He had gone off with a lady who was either a client or salesperson. At 2 minutes to 4pm\nI was able to ask the lady if our room was ready. The girl said: Yes, it is ready. I suspect that if I had not got in line, it would have been another 20-30 minutes before anyone called us or came over to see us. We were not impressed!\n\nThe bed was comfortable, but there was no plug or any USB port on one side of the bed to plug in and charge my  phone. My husband's side of the bed had multiple options for charging his phone. It seems that there should be something on the other side of the king bed.\n\nThe washroom is tiny for a new hotel. It's one thing when you are staying at an older hotel like the Fairmount and you have smaller washrooms, but a newer hotel should have a bit more room especially if it is a 5* hotel. To be honest, it felt like a brand new Best Western. I would call it a 3* hotel. If I was being generous. I'd give it 3.5-4 stars but only because it is quite new.

For a long time I've thought of the Village of Stowe as a modern day comparable to the Exiled court of Duke Senior exiled to the forest of Arden in Shakespeare's exploration of the Pastoral myth.

It is a stunningly beautiful house, as you can see in the photos that have been posted.  It reminded me of some of the Adirondack \""lodges\"" built by industrial barons in the 1920s, only on a smaller scale.  The owners have not cut any corners. The house, furnishings, fixtures and amenities are all of the highest quality, right down to the Nespresso coffee maker in our room.\n\nFor those people who shy away from lodges or B&Bs because they feel there is a lack of privacy, that is not a concern.  Most of the rooms are in a separate area of the very large house.  They are private and quiet.   It is very comfortable staying in your room if you wish.  But the common areas of the house are so attractive and comfortable that you will want to spend time in those areas as well \n\nWhile the physical space and the scenery are wonderful,  what really made our stay at Stowe Meadows was the world-class hospitality provided by Caroline.  Other reviews describe her graciousness and hospitality.   I also have an experience to relate that illustrates this.  While we were staying at Stowe Meadows it began snowing heavily.  Caroline had recommended a restaurant and made a reservation for us for dinner.  But before it was time for us to leave for dinner another set of guests got their car stuck in the snow in the long driveway leading up to Stowe Meadows, completely blocking the roadway so that no car could pass.  AAA was called but their ETA was well after our restaurant reservation.   Caroline said not to worry.  She had pizza fixins and plenty of wine in the house and we woild have an impromptu pizza-making party instead.   She (and her daughter who was visiting for the weekend) then proceeded to start preparing a large selection of ingredients to go on pizzas and crusts while the three guest couples staying at the lodge that night drank wine. Then we all made our own pizzas and had a wonderful and special evening together eating pizzas and drinking wine while the snow fell.  And despite all of the extra work Caroline and her daughter went to that night, the next morning she was up early to make a gourmet breakfast for the three couples.  \n\nIf you are looking for a memorable and special getaway, you cannot go wrong staying at Stowe Meadows.",5,positive,"March 6, 2015",3233 Elmore Mountain Rd,Elmore,Vermont,05661-8076

I saw photos online of the B&B, but I couldn\u2019t help a little ohhh and ahhh at this exquisite property when we arrived.\n\nStowe Meadows is truly a hidden gem!  This one-of-a-kind property is perched on a hill with stunning views of Mount Mansfield and Stowe Mountain.  We were greeted at the door by Erich, one of the B&B owners.  He was super friendly and welcoming but not overbearing.  We met his wife, Caroline, later in the week.\n\nWe were the only guests during our Sunday through Friday stay.  Stowe Meadows\u2019 decor is true mountain style with stone fireplaces, exposed reclaimed wood beams, and a gorgeous trickling fountain to name a few features.  We stayed on the lower level in the Alpine suite with a picture window view of the mountains.  It was really tranquil with a super comfortable four-poster bed, double sinks in a spacious bath, and ample storage.  To be honest, it felt like we were staying at a friends\u2019 house (a really big one!), and we were very much at home during our stay.\n\nWhen Erich showed us to our room, he asked what time we would like breakfast and confirmed that we are both gluten free and that I\u2019m dairy free.  He asked if there were any foods we didn\u2019t like.  As you may have guessed, breakfast at Stowe Meadows is tailored to your dietary specifications.  Who doesn\u2019t love a custom breakfast?  Each day we devoured two courses of the most delicious, clean, satisfying breakfast we\u2019ve eaten while traveling.  It was the perfect way to start the day, leaving us full and satisfied.\n\nThe only drawback is that Stowe Meadows is located 15 minutes from Stowe\u2019s Lower Village, or 25 minutes to Stowe Mountain.  The drive is beautiful and we had time to relax and chat in the car, so it wasn\u2019t an issue for us.  We\u2019ve stayed in Stowe\u2019s Lower Village in a townhouse, an Inn, as well as another property 10 minutes from the mountain.  They all have their pluses and minuses, but if you can swing the extra 15, it\u2019s well worth it. \n\nWhen we visit Stowe again without our daughters, we would definitely stay at Stowe Meadows again.

What really stands out is his generosity, great attitude, and willingness to ensure you have a good stay. When our car got stuck pulling into driveway at midnight due to the high snow accumulation that night, he was out of bed and starting the tractor within minutes. While we ended up using a combination of tractor and shoveling that night, his great attitude, calmness and smiles turned what would normally have been a painful and frustrating experience into a breeze. His willingness to help was evident on many more occasions, but this was certainly notable.\n\nStowe Meadows is a truly gorgeous home away from home. The pictures on their website actually look just like the property.

They made our stay feel as if we were at home with family. They were genuinely interested in who we were as people and what we were here for. They gave us the best advice on where to eat and where to shop. \nThe rooms were beautiful with the most adorable and thoughtful touches: Vermont bottled water, Vermont made chocolates, flowers, coffee maker, and snacks. \nThe bathroom was full of little thoughtful touches as well. Face cleansing wipes, handmade body scrub\u002F bubble bath and much more. Caroline and Erich didn\u2019t miss a beat!

We made our reservations over the phone and it proved to be very helpful. Having never been to Stowe, we had a lot of questions about the area. Caroline, who runs the inn with her husband Erich, provided a list of things to see and do and followed up with an email with additional information on each. The one thing we knew we wanted to do was check out the restaurant Hen of the Wood in Waterbury, but were told by friends that they are sometimes booked a month in advance. Caroline was able to arrange that for us, too! Needless to say, we had high hopes when we arrived. And everything exceeded our expectations. We stayed in the master suite, which is right off of the main living area and kitchen. The room is huge, decorated beautifully and had amazing views of the mountains. We were greeted with fresh flowers and even chocolates! The bathroom is magnificent with his and her loos and sinks, a massive jetted tub and an unbelievable shower, which we hope to replicate in our own home. The bed was phenomenal and confirmed our decision on buying a memory foam mattress. All of the linens were so exceptional that we, as well as the other couples staying there over the same weekend, inquired about the brands of the sheets, blankets and pillows. Caroline and Erich are incredible hosts and felt like friends we had known for years. Their adorable little girl, Helena, only adds to the sweet, home-like atmosphere of this inn. Definitely take a spin around the grounds on snowshoes (provided). We took one of their beautiful dogs with us and had a blast. Oh, and the breakfasts! Simply amazing.

Charming, warm and attentive, they looked after our every need with genuine pleasure. They were present and yet not intrusive. They re-arranged their dinning room to better accommodate our wine tasting on Friday night, re-arranged it again for breakfast and made it look like it was no big deal to move all the furniture around. \n\nTalking about breakfast, I must say that they serve an amazing coffee... with each Bodum (French Press) brought to your table as the coffee is seeping. I did not keep track of the number of courses, but we had plenty of quality food for everyone.

There's a sauna, a spa and even a little cold pool if you want to do the whole Scandinavia treatment. There's a small sitting room, with a TV, books, DVDs and board games. I wished we had more time there so we could just sit and relax, play games and read. The room was very clean and we had a private balcony. We did not hear the other guests, the walls were thick enough to assure privacy. When we woke up the next morning, there was coffee, fruits and orange juice waiting for us just outside our door. The breakfast was served at 9AM so we took our time in our room with the coffee. The food was really good. The owner gave us two choices: omelet or yogourt and granola. Both of us took the healthy breakfast but the omelet looked great. There was another couple at the table and we were lucky enough to make new friends. The owner spent some time with us and was really friendly. It's also really close to the town centre, everything is available by walk. I really hope we get to go there again, it was like staying at a family member's house.

While difficult to get into the B&B the first time you arrive (multiple door locks), once you have the keys you are all set. The breakfasts are excellent in this 3-4 room accommodation (a mini-pre-breakfast delivered outside your room consists of tea or coffee, fresh juice, and a bowl of fresh fruit, and another of flowers), crepes by Ireyna (sorry if I got that wrong) were superb. The hostess was very nice, welcoming, polite, helpful and just a wonderful person. The facilities here are above average--there's a separate spa at the back of the house with 2 beds and ambiance from a temperamental radio (sometimes works, sometimes does not). The masseuse is good. Remember to bring a swimsuit (or not) for the outdoor hot tub. In summer there is a small plunge pool for dipping. The reduced rating from 5 star is due to the best room, La Romance, having no shower or bath facility. In the room there is a very good 2-person hot tub\u002Fbath that takes 15-20 minutes to fill. If you stay 3 nights you'll find that you stop using the hot tub then play gymnast trying to use the spray head to wash your hair. Also, the tub is used after being in the spa and the oils are not good for the system. In fact, when we first got in the tub we had the joys of \""previous users\"". If you reject the tub, there is no way to wash your hair, so I went 2 days without shower etc. I could not stay in this room again.

The b&b sits on a picturesque property with a charming living room, lovely deck with a hammock in which I napped and a large beautifully manicured yard curated with separate private seating areas with Adirondack chairs. Pierre and Christine are wonderful hosts and serve a 3 course breakfast every morning. They home make and hand craft fine French plates daily with home made accoutrement to top home baked breads. They can happily accommodate food allergies as in my case of having celiac. They even made the same dishes with gluten free flour. IMPRESSIVE. Their coffee was the best we had since arriving in Canada and they will happily make you a thermos upon your return from dinner so you can enjoy the living room and deck before going to bed. Their rooms are nicely decorated and immaculately clean. They have fans and a\u002Fc although it cooled down in the evening so the a\u002Fc wasn't needed for all 3 evenings.

The house is old-ish and has a lot of character (in a good way!). When we arrived Christine and Pierre (the owners) had just returned from Peru I think, and I think I remember them saying they travel to South America regularly. You can see it in the paint colours, the wall hangings, and the other aesthetic choices they've made whilst decorating the house, which adds to the warm and cosy feel of the B&B. Our room was cosy and relaxing. There was no TV, which often is the first thing I look for in a hotel, but I have to say I'm so happy that there wasn't a TV, because it added to how restful the home was. At night it was quiet, and in the mornings a small group of us would sit around the table and Christine and Pierre would bring out several courses and describe each one (always local, always freshly made, always DELICIOUS!). It honestly felt like we were visiting family. We don't have a lot of money and so were hesitant to stay there, but it was close to the wedding we were attending, so we sucked it up and paid for three nights. I am SO happy that we did that. It was money very well spent. After the first night I honestly felt as though I'd been magically healed by the fresh air, quiet space and wonderfully comfortable mattress. I'd had a sore back and felt a cold coming on, but I woke up feeling well. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer, and that we didn't have more time to just laze about the B&B, read some books, take in the lovely yard, and lie out on the hammock.

This charming B&B has had new owners since Oct 2014 and the new owners have paid attention to previous reviews and have been upgrading the experience, and have many planned imporvements for the future. For example, they now serve breakfast to order, rather than cereal and make your own waffle (gaufre) as in the past. I was there with my ten year old son while skiing at Owl's  Head. Our breakfast was Eggs (cooked to order), home fires, fresh fruit, real orange juice, coffee or tea, and toast served with a variety of compotes and jellies. Also, if you don't wish to go out for dinner at night, the hostess Lynn does have dinner options available, and although I did not sample it (we took her recommendations for a nearby restaurant) , her kitchen did smell delicious with the smell of pork roast and broiled potatoes and gravy ! Nice touches include chocolate dipped fruit in the room to welcome you, a fireplace lounge with a TV, and a downstairs game\u002Fexercise room with a 3D TV system and both Wii and Xbox game systems for the children.  This is a family run resort and Lynn and Luc and extremely hospitable and met or exceeded every (mostly typical) request made of them during our stay. This property is a converted farm house, and there is kyaking and swimming in the summer on their pond and river, and kids can go sledding right off of the back deck of the hotel in t he winter.  Rooms are not large, and have no TV's (standard double room), but did come with everything promised in their listing including hair dryer and standard bathroom amenities.  Hosts were very knowledgeable about the local area (Don't forget to ask about the monster in Lake Memphemagog!) and were eager to support other local businesses with their recommendations, which is a big positive in my book.  Delightful family with a very comfortable and charming hotel. You will enjoy your stay as long as you are not looking for a five star spa experience or need a 1000 sq. ft. room.  Coca Cola themed dining room, located on Route 243 four to five miles north of the main Mansonville intersection. Hotel was very clean, I am a bit sensitive to dust and what not and I did not sneeze once or have any congestion issues whatsoever so their cleanliness was important to me.

(Amazing skiing, btw) While googling hotels and B&Bs, I found La Chouette De Mansonville...and oh, what a find!  I travel a lot, and have stayed in some pretty swank hotels with all of the amenities one could wish for...let me just say that I would pick La Chouette over them any day!  My husband and 10- and 12-year old daughters agree wholeheartedly.  The 10-year-old said, \""Mom, this is WAY BETTER than all of the fancy hotels we've stayed in.  This is my favorite hotel EVER!\""  Here's why (in no particular order):\n* VERY WELCOMIMG hosts.  Lyn and Luc, made us feel like friends rather than guests. Their toddler grandson, Alexi, was also charming and entertaining.  One typical example:  The first night we arrived, they must have seen the exhaustion from a marathon day of skiing on our faces.  So, she asked us if we would prefer to eat dinner there...she had some leftovers from her family's meal.  Would we like some vegetable soup, homemade rolls, mashed potatoes and meatloaf?  Would we ever?!  The meal was fabulous...and they did this to be nice...lunches and dinners are not served.\n* The VIEW -- the guest room windows, as well as the guest lounge area (big screen TV, DVD player, comfy couch, fireplace) all have an amazing view of the valley and mountains.\n* The BREAKFASTS -- made to order breakfasts...we always had a choice of pancakes, waffles, eggs, a meat such as bacon, homemade rolls or bread (both to die for), homemade jam and marmalade, local maple syrup, and fruit.  The portions were HUGE.  As a result, we never felt the need to eat lunch while skiing...just a quick afternoon snack.\n* CHARMING, clean rooms -- each room has a motif (ours was the lilac room) and a nice eclectic mix of antique furniture.\n* The AMENITIES for kids and kids at heart:  a sledding hill, a pond for ice skating (or swimming in the summer), a kayak for the summer.  Also, the La Chouette has a large basement recreation room that stretches the length of the B&B.  Movies, Wii, exercise equipment, etc.  \n* The ATMOSPHERE -- Lyn and Luc have made a conscious decision to do whatever they can to encourage guests to mingle and get to know each other.  Hence, no TVs in our individual rooms.  It was refreshing...we played games and socialized with the other guests...instead of mindlessly watching TV or having our noses buried in our electronics.  That said, if you do want to watch TV or a movie, the big screen TV in the common area is there.  Wifi is also available in the common areas...we were also able to access it from our room.\n* The PRICE -- $65 (for a double) to $85 (for a quadruple) for a room is unheard of these days.\n\nI can't say enough great things about both this B&B, as well as Owl's Head for skiing.  Although we were only 25 minutes from Jay Peak, we found that Owl's head offered us enough variety of trails for all levels and beautiful scenery (Who doesn't love vistas of frozen lakes and mountains?) that we had no desire to battle the crowds at Jay Peak.

We are avid hickers and need to bring our dog when we travel.   This is the only place that allows dogs that we found in Sutton.\nWe'll start with the positive....  The place is clean, the reception staff is perfectly bilingual, professional, pleasant, well informed and very helpful with all our requests.  The location is very good for hickers.  Good bed.\nNow the not so positive ...  Way too expensive for the quality. \nWe have stayed in a Condo the first time and a studio the next.  Both units have terrible humidity problems the Condo even had mold spots on one wall.  The studio smelled of dampness and not fresh (although it was very clean).  The linens are not of nice quality.  There are no bathroom amenities such as soaps  and shampoos other than a soap wall dispenser that is supposed to do everything, so if you decide to stay bring your own.  The room amenities are not great either, small cheap flat screen tv, kitchen utensils, pots and pans no more than dollar store quality, cheap filter coffemaker and don't forget your ear plugs for the AC unit noise.  The hot tub is a residential model for 5 people max so when the place is full you have to wait a turn and you'll be cramped with other people.  The heated pool is heated with a heat exchanger so until it is hot outside the pool is not properly heated.  the BBQ's available are ricketty and residential types that you buy at the big box stores and need to be updated.  Don't count on using the activites because everything  closes up by 8pm on a Saturday night!  In short it feels like at cheap roadside motel you pay $ 89 a night,  not $175 a night we paid for a little studio.  The last thing we need to mention is the breakfast.  It was terrible when we stayed in August and although a little improved in May, certainly not worth the $11 the owner tries to push on you.  Take the money and go into the town to a hotel with a restaurant called LE PLEASANT (a lovely boutique hotel with fabulous service, and staff, in an enchanting decor)  it is just down the road from the hotel and for about  the same price you will be served a memorable meal in beautiful surroundings.  \nOur recommendation to you is to stay at this hotel if you want to travel with your pet.

I especially empathize with hotel owners as reviews can be incredibly unfair and the experience so subjective. Some people are just unreasonable. Full disclosure, I'm at the stage of life where I've has the privilege of staying in the comfort of some very fine hotels the world over. That said, over the last 40-plus years, I've spent my share of nights at  the likes of 'Motel 6,' so I feel I'm imminently qualified to distinguish low price from low value. Sadly, Le Montagnard, for me, falls into the latter category of low value. Poor value, to be more precise. My recent one night stay at the hotel cost a considerable $374.85. While I wasn't expecting the Ritz Carlton, I do think it fair to have expected the hotel unit to have proper finishings, to be clean, and to have a usual supply of amenities like toilet tissue. In this case, we were given a ground floor unit in a two story a-frame cottage. The unit was in disrepair and seemed in the midst of incomplete renovations with green painter's tape across the floor and tiles with seams that had yet to even be grouted. There was an unpleasant (gross) odour in the air despite a dehumidifier prominently chugging away in the hallway. Amenities in the rather cramped washroom included a wall dispenser for hand soap and 3\u002F4 of a roll of toilet paper. To be fair, the hotel gave us more toilet paper after going to the reception desk to pick it up. The unit included a small kitchenette with some dishes with which to have breakfast. I was rather taken by a sign affixed above the sink warning that improperly washed dishes would result in an additional $25 charge. I wonder then whose responsibility it was to clean away the several dead flies I found in the bathtub. Surely, a better job could be done to ensure a basic level of cleanliness. Despite my best intentions to be a good citizen, a broken dishwasher added insult to injury. Another major nit for me was the lack of any sound isolation between units. I can only assume the guests staying in the unit above us we're practicing parkour or herding elephants or both. Again, not the end of the world but definitely not something you'd expect at this price point. If my night's stay was 1\u002F3 the cost, would I say it represents fair value? Maybe, but it's still not for me. Unfortunately, I can't see returning to Le Montagnard at any price until these issues are addressed.

data\ca\499380\208957\347443468.html,Horizon Hotel,"""To be clear in this review, we are staying in the H Chalets which is part of the hotel, but located away from the main hotel. I'm writing this after our first night of a two night stay, but can't see things getting any better.\n\nFirst of all, the concept and exterior appearance of these chalets is quite good. A cute little private chalet located in the woods with as they say on their website, room for six with wood stove heating sounded lovely. They were a bit pricey, but the pictures looked nice so we decided to book.\n\nWe arrived last night and the first alarm bells started to ring. First off, the young man at reception barely said hello when he asked for the balance of our payment. His customer service skills were non-existent. We asked if there was any information about the hotel he could give us - he said you have everything you need in the chalet (turned out not to be true). \n\nNext up, he gives us a map showing our chalet with a convenient parking area next to it. But wait, that is not our parking area - no, we are to park in the next area down the hill! Why I ask? \""Because that's the way it is\"" he responds.\n\nI then ask about the wood supply for the woodstove. He curtly informs me that wood is available for purchase at $8 per bag. I point out that there website states that the chalets are heated by wood stove (with supplementary electric heat). His response is \""wood is $8 per bag\"". Oy - at this point we're all tired from our drive so we head over to the chalet to settle in. \n\nOur next surprise is when we step inside. Thankfully there are only four of us, because you would need a very friendly group to manage 6 people in this space. The \""living room\"" consists of a futon for 2 people and an additional chair - not even enough seating for our group of 4, nevermind 6.\n\nThe interior is quite rustic with exposed wiring and plumbing. Everything is made of wood which is great, but if there was a corner to cut in construction they found it. All other furniture is completed with Ikea decor - the lowest end possible. The futons are bum-numbing and the beds have got to be the most uncomfortable I've ever slept on.\n\nOur next surprise arose when I broke down and bought the bag of wood. After driving back up to reception to pay for it (they don't seem to have the concept of giving your credit card once for incidentals) and waiting for an hour for their \""wood guy\"" to deliver it, I was presented with a bag that included 6 pieces of thin spruce shims (the kindling) and a bag of full-sized, wet logs. \n\nNow I've been building fires for over 40 years and have been able to make almost anything burn, but despite my best efforts, I couldn't get the soggy mess lit. I once again drove to reception (after trying to call for 10 minutes) and finally a new face (I presume the manager) seemed to understand my dilemma and had a bag of dry wood sent over. The wood guy admitted that he was new at this and had delivered quite a bit of wet wood that evening.\n\nQuite frankly there were several other issues (no soap in the bathroom?) and for the money they charged I was quite frankly expecting better service and value for money.\n\nThey have a foundation to work from, but really need to pick up their game to get to the level they are claiming to play at.",2,negative,"February 13, 2016",297 Maple,Sutton,Quebec,J0E 2K0

The access to the cabins is rocky and uneven and there are no structured paths. Also the shower stall is small and has steps which are awkward.

It was a beautiful little cabin, next to what appears to be an elegantly renovated old hotel on the slope of Sutton Qc...but their were some glaring opportunities missed that impacted the stay.\n\nFirstly I has reserved, based on my wanting to bring my girlfriend for a romantic, cozy evening at this mountainous retreat and yet upon arrival there quite late (8pm after dinner) there was no firewood at the chalet for the wood stove...BOOM lost opportunity for a warm cozy evening by the fire. When I inquired in the morning I was told we had to buy the firewood (Gulp, okay) but no one offered it to us at checkin so how would we know that ???\n\nSecond there was no soap in the bathroom!!! There was a blowdryer, there was dishwasher and dishwasher pucks, there was salt and pepper, cutlry, napkins, toilet paper...just no soap. When I inquired, I was told you have to bring your own!!! But how would we know that...???\n\nLastly I was shocked to notice quite by chance that the ceiling smoke detector was missing entirely!!! The base was there but the unit had been removed and this in a ALL WOOD cabin with a wood stove (admittedly that wasnt used because we were not supplied wood) and a firepit just outside the door.\n\nI brought my concerns to the front desk in the morning, and the young man was not forthcoming and beside the responses I have noted above, he displayed a lack of empathy and non-chalant attitude with no offer of compromise.\n\nThe chalet was new, nicely built, had great parking, was in a gorgeous woodlot, the beds were comfortable...the place was sparsely furnished but perfect for a summer\u002Fwinter stay in the wooded Mont Sutton...BUT it really dropped the ball on service opportunities on easily fixed mistakes.

This stay was suppose to be the final ski adventure of the season for myself and my skiing companion, but illness turned it in to a solo trip for me.  I arrived earlier than anticipated and was greeted warmly by Julie, the innkeeper.  She gave me an overview of the property and local dining establishments, while providing hot apple cider and cookies, which drove out the feel of the rather damp and dreary day.  I was then shown to my room, the Green Mountain Suite, which was far more spacious than I had anticipated.  The room is very open, with lovely wood floors, and a soapstone gas fireplace in the corner.  A microwave, small fridge, sink, a coffee maker, as well as assorted glasses and plates, would allow guests to prepare their own apre ski feast if they wished.   A small television is wall mounted, and may be viewed from either the couch or bed, which was convenient.  The website for the inn touted that the bathroom was equipped with a two person jetted tub, which I found to be Olympic size.  There is also a corner shower, which I will discuss later.  The room was very light filled, but when the blinds were lowered, even those who are light sensitive should have no trouble sleeping.  Breakfast the next morning, which was prepared by John, the other innkeeper,  was served promptly at the reserved time, and was quite good.  Definite homemade touches, including the warm muffins which started the meal, added to the overall charm of the inn.   I also need to mention that the room contained a binder with the Wi-Fi password as well as a history of the inn and suggested driving tours throughout the area, which were color coded for various seasons.  The friendliness of the inn keepers, the cleanliness of the property, and the overall experience make me want to rate the Fitch Hill Inn as excellent, but two small items won't allow me to.  The aforementioned shower was somewhat lacking in pressure, and never quite got steamy hot, which is how I like to shower.  The only other shortcoming is the king bed.  Again this is a personal preference, but I found the mattress to be a little firmer than I like, but it was comfortable.

At our host's recommendation we went to the Bees Knees in Johnson for dinner, then went back to the Inn where we had a pleasant conversion with John and then watched a movie.  \nIn the morning we had another  good breakfast (berries on yogurt, blueberry muffins, egg souffl\u00E9), then went skiing on the trails by  the high school.  Though not  as extensive as commercial areas, they as just a few minutes from the Inn, are well groomed, and free.  For lunch we stopped at Sweet Crunch Bake Shop for some great sandwiches.\nWe were very lucky to have wonderful snow, great weather and overall as good a weekend as you can ever have, and the Inn was definitely a large part of what made it so good.

She took care of every detail in advance, and was very easy to plan with in advance over the phone and email.  Various little details, such as bringing our own wedding cake toppers, were easily incorporated.  There was a small group of couples at the Inn at the same time, and everyone we spoke with had similarly good things to say.  The food was terrific, both the breakfasts and our wedding dinner.  The ceremony was in the back yard, with just ourselves -- it was incredibly peaceful and beautiful, with the mountains in the distant background.  The Inn is located in a small town near Stowe, and although there is enough shopping and restaurants in the area if you need it, there is virtually no traffic sound.  Our room faced the street, but we had perfect quiet the whole time.  The justice of the peace was also wonderful, and accomodated some special requests as well.  Overall it was just a very memorable, really perfect elopement, like something out of a dream almost!  I cannot say enough good things about this B&B and Suzanne.  And also, all of this was made possible for an extremely reasonable rate.  A far cry from the stress, headache, and expense you see on the Bridezillas shows.  We wanted a totally calm, quiet, intimate elopement, and that is exactly what we got.  I have to say, it was way better than I could have even hoped for.  I highly recommend this B&B to anyone who wants a romantic getaway of any sort.  We will certainly be going back!",5,positive,"September 3, 2014",100 Main St. Pob 300,Hyde Park,Vermont,5655

data\ca\57288\492537\297529931.html,Governor&#39;s House in Hyde Park,"""I recently had the joy and good fortune to stay at the Governor's House in Hyde Park, VT. My two night stay was for a Jane Austen themed weekend, but throughout this review I shall evaluate the establishment for both 'regular' guests and those who may be seeking a specific themed experience.\nMy room was superb: on the ground floor, it featured hard wood floors, gorgeous moldings and an amazingly comfy queen size four poster bed dressed in exceptionally good quality linens.\nPlease let me note here that I am a VERY picky traveler - able to put up with a lot, but critical and cognizant of what constitutes 'the best' as far as furnishings and amenities go.\nThe room was spacious with excellent fenestration, a roomy closet and a wonderful bath with a deep soaking tub and a hand held shower. Bathroom amenities were locally sourced and produced. Hairdryer, robe, television with CD\u002FDVD player alarm clock etc. About the only thing this room did not have was a docking station for devices, but smart travelers carry charging plugs with them anyway, so a very minor thing. Also, there was no coffee\u002Ftea maker in the room, quite possibly to maintain the period feel of the appointments. Again - a small thing. BUT-there was a carafe of sherry with glasses, and that made up for it! \nRoom had a table and several padded chairs so a desk like place could be created easily. Also, a fireplace and two comfy wing arm chairs were cozy and inviting.\nThe place was spotlessly clean and smelled fresh and lovely. The entire establishment is smoke free!\nThere is no air conditioning in the House, but a box fan (provided in room) in the window brought in enough cool mountain air that sleeping was fine. Judicious adjustment of window shades and blinds also kept the room comfy enough during the day.\nAs for the rest of the House, it is a treasure trove of wonderful room and accoutrements just waiting to be discovered by visitors. A gracious parlor, a quiet library, both beckon on the main floor. Telephones are available on both main floors, tucked in cozy little snugs masquerading as a small greenhouse and a tiny sitting room. A very good and extensive selection of DVDs and VCR tapes is on offer for the use of visitors in the upstairs library, which also features comfy padded chairs for lounging and reading. There are books all over the House, from floor to ceiling in the library and on many available surfaces and in cases in other areas of the House.\nWiFi is available throughout the establishment, though signal strength can vary with distance from the modem and the number of people\u002Fdevices using it at any given time.\nA back veranda offers tranquil views of the mountains and the House's large lawn, ringed with blooming perennials and fruit trees.The entire place is screened by greenery, and although there are neighbors across the side street, guests rarely hear anything at all.\nA peek at other bedrooms (allowed, I wasn't being rude!) showed that each room is decorated in a different though equally tasteful manner, with period antiques, artwork and accessories.\nSuzanne Boden, who runs the House practically single-handedly, is a welcoming and extremely warm woman, whose knowledge of both area attractions as well as area history is deep and wide-ranging. Ask her anything: she will likely know, but if she doesn't, she will find out!\nThe House offers a full breakfast featuring muffins, eggs, porridge, fruit, coffee\u002Ftea, juice, etc. The weekend I was there, all the food was tied to the Jane Austen period in the early 19th century, so we were treated to baked eggs! \nSuzanne makes a point of asking prospective guests about any food allergies or special diets, and special requests are not a problem.\nFor the Jane Austen weekend, we also had a formal dinner and an evening of English Country Dancing in the main hall of the House. Suzanne produced an authentic early 19th century meal that was as delicious as it was historically accurate.Her choice of wines suited my palate perfectly: neither puckeringly dry nor cloyingly sweet, the white and the red were both delicious and perfect with the meal.\nWe also had wine at a little reception the first evening of our weekend, and it was just as good. \nIn addition to the wine, there is a small bar with spirits, and Suzanne again tells prospective guests to ask for anything in particular they might like. \nSo, for people looking to spend a weekend exploring the history of northern Vermont, or who come to the area to ski, or who just want a quiet weekend away, the Governor's House in Hyde Park is highly recommended. Exceedingly well appointed, with a hostess who embodies the spirit of that word in such a way as to put most others to shame, and with excellent home-cooked breakfasts, the Governor's House is an establishment I can recommend with no qualms or caveats whatsoever.\n\nFor those who are considering attending one of the House's Jane Austen or Downton Abbey weekends, I can only judge by the Austen weekend I just experienced, but I expect the Downton Abbey weekends are every bit as spectacular. Clearly, the early 18th century is a passion of Suzanne's, and she has attracted a coterie of 'regulars' to these weekends. However, newcomers should not be apprehensive about attending: they will be made to feel welcome, as another 'recruit' to the lure of all things Jane Austen is always a cause for celebration.\nPeriod correct events, such as archery, croquet, whist, carriage rides, sewing, English County Dancing, etc. are all on offer, and the weekend is crafted depending on the likes\u002Fdislikes of the guests. \nThe only disappointment of this weekend for me was the offer of riding. What is currently offered is Western style, astride; while I do ride this way, I have never ridden side saddle. Since side saddle was the way ladies rode in the early 19th century, I was hoping to get a lesson in that technique. But the stable does not offer this (yet - I am hoping they will in future).\nOther than that, the social gatherings and events Suzanne plans to allow guests to experience a weekend steeped in all things Austen are perfect. All events are optional, too, so guests need not feel pressured to rush from one thing to another (not easy to do, anyway, in a corset!). Period dress is encouraged, but again, optional, and a range of authenticity in said dress is enough to make anyone feel comfortable with their outfits--although perhaps longing for something more elaborate.\nI must close this review with a note about Suzanne Boden, the owner and proprietor of the Governor's House. Having renovated it extensively to return it to the glory of its heyday, she had managed to include all the 'mod cons' so that present day visitors have the amenities they expect, enrobed in the graciousness and beauty of an earlier time. Suzanne is one of the hardest working innkeepers I've ever encountered, doing the home cooking, the cleaning, the room refreshment, etc. herself, with perhaps one assistant. And yet, the place gleams! Anything you ask for is there! And best of all, Suzanne always has a smile on her face: her love for the House and her passion for it are readily apparent, and imbue every effort on her part, and thus every corner of the House, with an enthusiastic and yet tender regard.\nMake a visit to the Governor's House an item on your bucket list, either for a regular getaway or for one of the themed weekends.

We had found it on the internet and it looked fabulous. Then when we saw the Governor\u2019s Bedroom, that was it \u2013 we had to stay there. Still you don\u2019t really know what you will be in for, till you arrive, but we were not disappointed. \n\nWe drove up the driveway, still euphoric after surviving another day of driving on the wrong side of the road and gazed up at the big yellow mansion, wondering what we would find when we went inside. What we found was an amazingly restored period home, spotlessly clean, and a beautiful room to retire in after the rigours of touring Vermont.\n\nThe Governors Bedroom lived up to expectations - the linen was crisp and inviting, the room welcoming and well furnished, the supplied amenities appreciated and Suzanne entirely fitting as the proprietor of such a well run establishment. The sleepy balm left on your bed, with the chocolates was a lovely touch and the next morning, breakfast was as expected. The only negative about the Governors House, was that I live too far away for the Pride and Prejudice weekends \u2013 I could really get into the whole scene in that lovely home.\n\nSuzanne was most helpful with maps and ideas for our day rambles around the lovely area and when I advised that we would be hunting for the covered bridges of Vermont, she supplied us a map and pointed us in the right direction.  One little point that we were not aware of though, was that the lovely covered bridges are not on the main road, nor are sign posted, so after driving for miles and the map showing that we should have passed 15 covered bridges, we had a bit of a marriage tester. However after a few words on the top of a Vermont mountain, we eventually backtracked and found some of the lovely covered bridges. \n\nOn returning to The Governors House, we entertained Suzanne with our story and she advised us that when we were driving further down through Vermont, to cross over into New Hampshire and just before we cross back into Vermont, we will cross the best covered bridge ever.

While I realize it was mainly to make sure everything was OK, she could have popped in every now and then to ask. Wherever we were  hanging out, there she was hovering, making sure we were using coasters, keeping doors closed, keeping coolers full of ice off the hardwood floors, etc. It was almost as if she didn't really want to be opening up her home to guests.\n\nThe other issue with the place is that you could hear everything from your rooms - from the squeaky floors to the closing doors to people having conversations.\n\nThe breakfast she made each morning and the lunch she made on the day of the wedding were all fantastic.

On one occasion, the housekeeper knocked on the door and basically stated that they were very busy, implied that they could complete a full service and then asked us what we supplies we needed.  For over $500.00 per night, you should get a full service provided by a willing employee.  During a later conversation with a housekeeper, the housekeeper stated that the staffing had been reduced.\nc)  The checkout process had deteriorated.\nAt check-in, we gave the front desk attendant our credit card.  The attendant stated that we would have quick check-out and that all charges would be applied to the card.   The morning of checkout, our bill was placed under our door as expected, but the balance appeared to have not been paid in full.  That necessitated our joining a long line of people attempting to checkout.  Their was no speedy checkout.  Then once you settled the bill, you had to dodge cars, kids and thoughtless adults who placed their cars and belongings all over the front entrance and throughout the small parking area.\nThis may seem minor, but when you have rented two units for five days and with an average cost per night per room of $500, you should expect and should receive better service at check-in, at checkout and with the housekeeping service.",4,positive,"February 21, 2014",830 Jay Peak Rd,Jay,Northeast Kingdom,05859-7046

Plus there is a ski storage on the same floor as the lift tickets. There are also two restaurants (Alice's and Tower Bar) in the same facility. To top it off, you may be able to get valet parking inside the parking garage, which can make packing up easy. Again, I would recommend staying at the Tramhaus if skiing is your thing.

Otherwise you'll have to go to the Nordic center to rent equipment.\n\nThe suite itself (Suite 501) was fantastic. A full kitchen, two bedrooms and a living room with a pull-out couch.

It turned out to be one of the best decisions we ever made! Although we traveled many other places this year, we both agreed this was our favorite vacation. Sterling Ridge was the quintessential setting in which to relax and unwind at the end of the year.\n\nWe arrived around 3:30pm on Saturday, Christmas Eve, to check-in to our cabin. We were greeted and given information about the property and the area, handed our key, and off we went. We stayed in a one bedroom cabin at the back of the property which was divine. All of the cabins are arranged such that the front porches face away from each other, which maximizes privacy and gives everyone a great view.\n\nI can't say enough and the cabin and the property's amenities. Since we were staying an entire week, having a full kitchen at our disposal was immensely helpful. This included a full-size refrigerator, oven with stove top, and dishwasher. The kitchen had a basic set of pots and pans, knives, utensils, silverware, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, measuring cups, and pot holders. Essentially it had everything you should need to cook. I did a lot of cooking and key items I bought with me were a roasting pan (I made a whole chicken), Pam, cling wrap, foil, and tupperware for leftovers. Other than that - the cabin had everything! We really enjoyed the spacious one bedroom cabin which had a large bedroom (which even had a TV in it) and a living room with another TV and DVD player, couch, coffee table, and wood burning fireplace. There was wifi and cable TV, which was great for watching football!\n\nOn the property, you are able to buy firewood and kindling for $5 a bundle, although they do start you off with a bundle of each in the cabin. The doors to the self-serve area are open 24\u002F7 which was very convenient to pop in for more toilet paper, towels, trash bags, etc. if needed. While the cabin was amply stocked, we did run out of some items since we were there a full week. There are also wonderful trails around the property. We walked in the snow twice during the week, no show shoes needed.\n\nWe ventured into Stowe a few times which was just 40 minutes away, even with 108 being closed in the winter.

Although we enjoyed our previous stay at the mountain's resort condos, we wanted to try something different this year. I called Sterling Ridge Resort to inquire about the package they had on their website which included a 2-night stay in a studio cabin and 2 lift tickets to Smugglers' Notch. However, the misleading description on the owners' website leads one to believe that for the price PER PERSON, 2 nights and 2 tickets are included. The most unfortunate part, however, is the fact when calling to inquire about said package, the male owner absolutely assured me that I could buy two of the packages back-to-back, for a 4 night stay, and 8 tickets in a studio cabin for my boyfriend and I. I called the next day to reserve and spoke with a woman who booked us for a studio cabin for 4 nights and 8 tickets. She repeated \""8 tickets, 4 nights, 2 adults, in a studio cabin.\""\n\nWhen we arrived at the resort, we were ignored at the front desk and not even a 'Hello' was given in acknowledgment of our presence, regardless of the two people ahead of us talking in casual conversation. When we were finally noticed, the owner herself (presumably who booked my reservation) checked us in, handed us 4 tickets and told us where our cabin was located. It wasn't until I told her that we were owed 8 tickets, that she told me I misunderstood the online description and that the package included only one ticket for each of us for 2 days. However, the online description on their own website quoted the price per person which included 2 tickets. Not to mention, 2 people over the phone CONFIRMED 8 tickets total. She admitted her husband was 'confused' about her packages and asked us to 'meet her in the middle.' She then told us she 'upgraded' our cabin, as if trying to smooth over the ticket fiasco. Thinking this was a good thing, we met her in the middle (or so we thought) and left with 6 tickets and a 2 bedroom cabin.\n\nWhen we finally arrived to our cabin, our first impression was how beautiful it was, but definitely too big for only 2 people (it had room enough to sleep 6). We originally wanted a studio cabin because the cabins only have one TV in them and we both need to watch TV to help us fall asleep.

data\ca\57297\252099\5694009.html,Sterling Ridge Resort,"""We discussed what we wanted in a vacation.  Hiking, canoe trip, scenery, shopping, and privacy.  If we could find a log cabin somewhere, that would be ideal.  A quick google search brought us to Sterling Ridge.\n\nWe stayed at this property from Aug. 14 - Aug 21.  The website has plenty of photos from the property and it is represented quite well.  Since we are a party of 2, we decided on a deluxe 1 bedroom.  \n\nUpon arrival, my first thought was how the heck do people get up the hill on Junction Road without a 4x4?  That is a crazy entrance.  But once you get to the site, it is worth it.  We were greeted by the owner, Scott, who quickly ran down the property details for us.  Not much to checking in.  Just verify who you  are, get your directions to your cabin (we were in # 9) and off you go.  Each cabin is a property onto itself.  Although you can see others, you do have a lot of privacy.\n\nThe website states that each cabin comes fully equiped.  You can pretty much take that for heart.  We brought some extras just in case (tissues, papertowels, saucepan) and ended up not having to touch any of it.  You will find the kitchen is ready to go no matter what you need.  9x9\"" square and round cooking dishes, a larger cooking dish for a lasagna, 3 frying pans, cooking pots, all the utensils & accessories you could ever imagine that you would need.  Stove, microwave and fridge with freezer.  There is cleaning supplies to wash by hand, or a diswasher if you don't feel like washing.  There are also regular glasses as well as wine glasses (I brought those also without having to).  The cabins are extremely clean & the owners are strict on their no pet policy to ensure that no special cleaning is required.  I think this helps to keep the price competitive.\n\nOur cabin had a tv with built in vcr, but we were told that we could check out a dvd player if we wanted (no extra charge, and there were 3 available when we checked in) plus any movies that they had in their collection could be checked out (again no charge).  We only rented one night, but were able to get a good movie.  There are plenty of tv stations available.  And for us Canadians, CBC and CTV were also there.  Always nice to get the news from home when you are away.\n\nThere are no phones in the cabins.  I found this to be a plus, as I probably would have brought my work computer and set up.  No need.  There is a computer in the office which you can check your e-mail on.  We only had time to check one day.  The pool is small (only about 12.5m long) but very relaxing.  The view of the mountains while swimming is amazing.  The hottub by the pool is also a nice touch.  We didn't get a chance to use the game room, but I am told it is nice.\n\nWe managed to eat in every night and bbq all except our last night since it rained.  Having never cooked without a gas bbq before, I was a bit nervous, but we manged without a problem.  Cleaning is simple also.  \n\nThe most amount of work you will have to do is throw out your garbage and replace your towels.  The dumpster is close to the entrance, so we just dropped off everyday.  They also recycle which is great.  Towels are dropped off at the office and fresh clean ones are available all day.  There are never any questions about how many to take.  Just take what you feel you will need.  The office has pretty much everything to keep you running, but I found that the cabin was stocked when we arrived so no need to ask for more.  We only took a lightbulb since a light went out one day (they use high effeciency lightbulbs by the way).\n\nOverall, we found this property to be excellent.  Although at times it was full, we still had a lot of privacy and found the evenings to be very quiet.  There are plenty of activities on the property or within a short drive to keep you occupied.  Smugglers Notch ski hill is within a 10-minute drive.  Mount Mansfield  is probably about another 10-15 minutes away, but during the winter, the road that seperates these two places is closed.  Take a trip there in the summer and you will see why.  We enjoyed driving the route to Stowe almost everyday, but could not imagine how anyone would want to be on that road on an icy winter day.\n\nI highly recommend this property for your next vacation.\n",5,positive,"August 21, 2006",155 Sterling Ridge Dr,Jeffersonville,Vermont,05464-6485

Having read the prior raving reviews on this site, I was afraid I would be disappointed, but now I myself can't say enough about how wonderful this was place is. It was the perfect resort for a quiet family vacation.  The grounds were beautiful.  The pool was small, but never crowded. There were facilities for outdoor sports and a small game room with table tennis, a billard table, arcade games and foozball table. The pond was picturesque. There were scenic trails around the resort, and you can also walk the community trails from there.  There were frogs and butterflies for the kids to observe during the day. Max, the resort's golden retriever, was friendly and entertaining .  At night, we brought the kids stargazing.\n\n Although you could see neighboring cabins easily, there was a lot of privacy and each cabin had its own private view of the pond or woods. While we found it a perfect place for a family with kids, it was clearly also a great place for a romantic vacation. There were also bigger cabins for family reunions, that were located slightly apart from the others. \n\nWe were given cabin 13, by the pond, and it was perfect for us! We will definitely ask for that cabin again if (when!) we return. The two-room cabin had a full kitchen with all utilities, full stove, and dishwasher; a full bath (with whirlpool tub!), a grill and a picnic table on the outside. There was also a small television with VCR and  DVD player, and you can sign out videos in the office. Although the kids watched a couple of short movies at night, there was so much to do around the resort that the television was barely used.  The best part about the cabin was its location right by the pond, on the side where the boats dock. The kids loved to go out on the rowboats first thing in the morning and several times throughout the day. The pond was stocked, and I did see some folks fishing while on the rowboats.  The cabin  was also close enough to the main office and lodge so we could walk to the pool to swim.  There is no wi-fi in the cabins, but the office provides a computer for guests to use, and you can get wi-fi just outside the office. \n\nThere are some stores and restaurants nearby, but I recommend buying groceries before checking in (either at the Shaw's in Stowe or the Pricechopper in Morrisville).  It take about 20-30 minutes to get to Smuggler's Notch and Stowe. Although we went to those areas, we spent an entire day just enjoying the Sterling Ridge grounds.\n\nI don't think anyone looking for a quiet vacation, who loves nature and the outdoors will be disappointed with this resort.

There was homemade banana cake in the dining room, free drinks in the mini-fridge, and wonderful breakfast each morning. Don and Nimmie even made my husband and me tofu-bacon, since we are vegetarians. The house itself is gorgeous- yet also warm and homey.

I told Nimmie that I like to walk in the early morning and she suggested that I try Mills Riverside Park, which was less than 1\u002F2 mile down the road.  I returned in time for a delicious breakfast of a cheese blintz concoction that would be worth finding the recipe.

I stayed at the Sinclair Inn last March with my girlfriend to celebrate our one year anniversary in the Burlington Vermont area.  She and I researched many different Bed and Breakfasts, but Sinclair Inn stood out because of its easily accessible website with clear images of beautiful, warm rooms to stay.  In particular, when we inquired about a couple of their rooms, Nimmie responded immediately, and was extremely sweet and helpful.  Also, their prices were very reasonable compared to other B&B's we researched.  Once we decided to choose Sinclair Inn, the booking process was smooth and everything was in order.\n\nThe best part, though, by far was our experience once at the Sinclair Inn.  We arrived to a lovely restored Victorian nestled in the heart of Jericho VT only minutes from the Jericho downtown center.  Being 20-25 minutes away from Burlington proper, it was exactly what we were looking for because we had the best of both worlds; the gorgeous city of Burlington coupled with the picturesque rolling mountains of upper Vermont right in the backdoor of the Sinclair Inn.  We were greeted by Don, who was more than sweet, kind, and helpful, later giving us fantastic directions to a shortcut to Burlington that GPS generally does not take you through.  We chose the room on the first floor, which was spacious, clean, comfortable tastefully decorated, and above all warm and welcoming.\n\nIn the morning we were greeted by both Don and Nimmie.  Nimmie is extremely outgoing, and as warm as the Sinclair Inn itself, and served an incredible breakfast.  My girlfriend and I casually mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary, so later that night, when we returned to the Inn from spending the day in Burlington, we found a card and a bottle of wine for us.  We were so shocked and pleasantly surprised we thanked them as soon as we saw them the next morning.  That kind of thoughtfulness, that level of consideration is just something that you won't see everywhere, but you will definitely experience from Don and Nimmie at the Sinclair Inn.

They're the best! We feel so at home there! (A very  \ncomfy cozy home at that!) There's a DVD library that can make your  \nhead spin- every movie you can think of. The living room has a  \nfireplace, with comfy couches and complimentary snacks and  \nrefreshments available for your enjoyment!\nAnd of course the breakfast is INCREDIBLE!! Fresh fruit, orange juice,  \nand hot coffee wait for you to start with when you get there, a  \nDELICIOUS hot meal is cooked for you on the spot, and it always  \nincludes (at least in my experience) their wonderful homemade jams and  \nVermont's finest maple syrup!\nThank you Renee, you were always around and always helping us out! And of course thanks to Emmy, Karen, Patty, Justine, and Judy! You all made the stay better for us! \nThank you John and Jay!!!",5,positive,"March 20, 2011",195 Main St,Montgomery Center,Vermont,05471-7105

Though we were told we had been upgraded to a room in  the 'Carriage House' at no-cahrge, we were not, and found our room to be small and Not clean ( nicht sauber). Our room and in the main house in both of our opinions was EXTREMELY full of furniture,  antiques,  trinkets (Schmuckgegenstand), etc.  The owners seem pleasant, however, overcharged the bill.... the taxes are inflated on the bill and be advised, also INCLUDED  you will pay for Gratuity ( they charge 13%)  THOUGH you must ask for the service of having your room cleaned. This B&B being very Pet friendly is a plus, however, my German partner did not find that the owners walked their dogs AT All and this did strike a chord with her...  Back home in Germany, we enjoy walking our own dog on a daily basis and so we enjoyed walking John & Jay's two dogs\n( Westies).\nBreakfast is included in the price, however, Jay specifically said that there is no menu and breakfast is whatever John cooks.  When John is not available to cook, then we were given breakfast vouchers to the small restaurant  on the opposite side of the street. This was a plus because we were given a menu to choose from and did not have to pay, however naturally left the Server a tip.  The scenery in the area is beautiful.  Highlights: Jay Peak is close and we took a ride to the top, and we organised a canoe (Kanu) ride on a lake also in the area.  John and Jay have a Hot tub in the back of the house by the 'Carriage House', but make sure you go in it after it has been cleaned and free of chemicals\n( we experienced relaxing in the Hot tub, however it had just been cleaned and chemical residue would bubble-up and stay at the top of the water which we would then skim off with our hands).  The Television in our room was small. In the main house is a DVD library to choose from.  Coffee & coffee machine, and little fridge are in the room, as well a other beverages which are not complimentary.  In the afternoon snacks in the main house as well as coffeee is avaiable at no charge, however I do not think baked goods are fresh each day. \nOverall, Ok, but problems as noted above.

We drove down from Montreal and they drove up from CT; this time, we had 2 dogs in tow. \n\nWe were greeted by John, who showed us to our room and showed our dogs to their lush pillow and various treats (which they loved!). Of course, there were treats aplenty for the humans, too- and we indulged in lots of hot chocolate, tea, and home-baked goodies all weekend. Jay took a lot of time to talk to us about what we could do around town, and his suggestions were a hit. My parents went snowshoeing at Hazen's Notch, and my husband, 2 dogs and I went for a beautiful walk (off-leash) up a nearby snowmobile path, where the views were gorgeous. \n\nDinner downtown both nights was excellent (both times at Bernie's), and the breakfasts back at the inn were incredible! We were in a rush to leave on Monday morning, but they convinced us to stay to enjoy some ham and cheese stuffed crepes. Needless to say, we were so glad we did! They were probably the best crepes I've had in my life.\n\nNo detail is ignored at Phineas Swann. I am in awe of how much they had to offer (besides the food and great hospitality, they had tons of DVDs to watch, roaring fireplaces to sit by, and toiletries to use). My dad, who had forgotten his tooth brush, was offered an \""overnight kit\"" complete with a Phineas Swann emblem; he was amazed at all that was inside aside from the toothbrush.

From the moment you walk into Phineas Swann you experience a feast for the eyes. The decor is warm, charming and welcoming. There is something, pretty, or interesting to look at everywhere you look. The living room is comfortable and inviting, comfortable couches, fire in the fireplace. Fresh homemade muffins, brownies and homemade cookies are available with assortments of candies and coffee, tea and hot chocolate. There is an impressive selection of wine as well. The antiques and collection of stained glass, dog figurines and collectors tins and trays is amazing. I found myself seeing new things daily. The staff were warm, friendly and welcoming. Stacy and Jim Stevenson the Inn sitters were charming and gave me a tour of the B & B.\nThey were a font of information about the area, restaurants and local activities and attractions. As this was my first time visiting Vermont, it was very helpful. Additionally, this was my first time staying in a B & B. I have traveled extensively and stayed in many 5 star resorts but Phineas Swann made me feel just as pampered. The soft linens and down comforter felt like sleeping on a cloud. Every luxury was thought of from the high end soaps, shampoos, monogrammed soft robes, thick soft towels and every conceivable green tea I could drink. The room decor was tasteful, charming and warm and welcoming. I enjoyed the fireplace in my room that I could turn off and on as needed. I also enjoyed the jacuzzi tub in my bathroom after a long day of exploring the area. I felt cocooned in luxury and charm. The selection of classic DVD's was impressive.  The breakfasts were served by a friendly lady named Karen. The blueberry waffles, pancakes and omelets made to order were delicious.   The dining area was really nice, and anything I wanted was available. I was also impressed with the love of dogs and accommodations for dogs. Even the dogs get spoiled and pampered at Phineas Swann. There are dog treats and food and water bowls in every room.The owners dogs Bobo and Emma were there to greet me everyday. Because my dog was back in Florida it made me miss my baby less. Emma and Bobo were charming and adorable! The grounds at Phineas Swann are just as charming as the inside. The flowers were just beginning to bloom and Mike the maintenance man and grounds keeper does a good job of keeping everything looking beautiful.  I would also like to mention that right within walking distance are two really delicious restaurants, great Mexican food at Bernie's, and yummy fish and chips at the Snow Shoe. I also enjoyed Jay Peak Ski Resort for cocktails and a delicious dinner at the Belfry on the way down the mountain. Food at the Belfry is not to be missed!

But they treat you really well.  \n\nJay and John, the owners, do a great job creating not just a welcoming place but one with a lot of character and charm.  If I wanted to stay in a neutral, modestly decorated place, I would have done a hotel and ordered room service for breakfast.  But I stay in B&B's (only 5 so far, admittedly) because I want to get to know the owners a bit and stay in a place that is more like a home.  Jay and John have decorated this place to the nines.  Much of it is dog-related but that's fine - the point is that it is _their_ place and I can tell.  I feel like a real guest in a _home_.  Not a hotel.  \n\nThey also make it even more welcoming in that they stay out of the guest areas of the place (almost everywhere) so that we can feel free to roam around, sip the free cider\u002Fhot chocolate\u002Fcoffee eat the free cookies\u002Fbrownies or have some wine (honor system) without them being right there.  This is very consistent with other B&B's and is very appreciated.  \n\nThe Swann is in a really, really old farmhouse, i think, and the structure feels like it.  The stairs are like climbing a steep hillside (exercise those calves!) and the floor in our room was actually slanted and not level.  And the room wasn't really big.  But that's what you get for a 100 year old place that wasn't originally designed for this.  It's been wonderfully redone and has better facilities - bathroom, electrical, etc - than some hotels I've been in.  It's part of the charm.  \n\nAs with another B&B I've been in that got a negative review - if you are looking for a hotel, don't stay here.  If you are looking for a brand new place with a wait staff, etc, then don't stay here.  But if you want the charm and feel of a B&B, cared for by private owners, then this is a great place.  \n\nWe unfortunately did not see much of John when we were there, but Jay was great during breakfast, talking to everyone, genuinely excited to chat, and offered great advice on where to go and what to do.  This was flat out fantastic.\n\nMy only quibbles are that the breakfast, while good, is also really, really heavy and I felt a bit rushed.  Not that the staff was pushing us out or anything but I didn't feel really relaxed during it.  I think they might use a bit too much oil and or butter, too - stomach was rather unprepared that first morning and had a bit of an ache all day.  The other is that Montgomery Center is quite far north in Vermont.  A beautiful place and certainly the bridges are there all the time, but if you're going for foliage then you risk missing it by going so far north.  We were extremely lucky to hit it right at the peak but only because it was late this year.  It's a bit tiring of a drive from NYC.  \n\nBut then again, it's close to Stowe (and the surrounding, quaint towns) so that's not bad.

I kind of wanted to hint that if there wasn't room on the walls for all of the taxidermy, so they had to put it into other things, maybe there was enough.\n\nAll that said, the welcome was genuine, and our dog was happy to be at the Phineas.

From the moment you walk into the Inn, you are greeted by the warm scent of mulled apple cider and, if you are lucky and she is out, an adorably sweet bull dog penned up in the kitchen just waiting for you to come greet her. We stayed in the Green Room the first night (it has a little more wiggle room for ski gear than the Red Room, if you have to choose between the two), and also has a very comfortable bed that was perfect for sinking into after hitting the slopes.  In the main house, details abound: complimentary candies (including my favorite: jelly bellys, to which Jay so kindly gave me a large cup of to take back with me to my room), coffees, and cookies; delicious breakfasts that will leave you full and energized (blueberry pancakes one morning, french toast the next, crepes another...); and the most beautiful, warming decor I have ever seen during the holiday season at an Inn.\n\nWe stayed at the River House (first floor) the remaining nights.  The apartment is spacious, with a comfy sofa, gas fireplace and kitchen that was great for those nights that we just wanted to stay in and cook.  The space is much \""simpler\"" than the main house - don't expect it to be the most modernized space - but there was definitely an endearing quality to it, which is why we selected it in the first place.  My one qualm would be that the bed is not as comfortable as the one in the main house. We will be looking to stay here again when we come back in the summer with our dogs (that is another great perk about the Inn and, if you allergic and\u002For don't like dogs, the main house does not permit them in the bedrooms, so you will still be able to greatly enjoy your stay).\n\nOverall, the staff was extremely accommodating.  I can't say enough about Jay, who went out of his way to make sure that we were enjoying every bit of our stay, from making sure that our lift tickets, which Jay Peak had messed up, were corrected, to the aforementioned candies.

The meal was reasonably priced and very tasty. The service was slow, so it's not the place to go if you're in a hurry, but it was a very good meal.\n\nThe Canadian border is about a twenty-minute drive; we stopped in a cute town called Sutton for a coffee, and then drove a bit further to Brome du Lac, where we had a good lunch.

His first reason for choosing the Phineas Swann B&B was because they allowed pets. His decision was easily made as he spoke with Jay and Jenny on the phone. They offered so many ideas and were so wonderful in planning every detail of my surprise; even taking into account some of my picky eating...Driving north from Connecticut (a beautiful drive where the mountains keep getting bigger) we got to stop at Ben & Jerry's about an hour and a half before pulling into the B&B. The beautiful Victorian home right on main street draws you in. We were welcomed by Jenny, who seemed to already know us, and the resident pups. The place is just as perfect as you can imagine. Warm and inviting, the thousands of dog antiques and collectibles were carefully decorated throughout the house, so many things to take in. The common area was filled with treats, baked goods, soda, etc\u2026Anything you may crave. There were puzzles, board games and books; all of those fun little things you never find time for at home. Jenny suggested that we stay in the River House-It was so special: Set behind the carriage house, it is another antique home with an apartment on the first floor and one on the second floor. We were happy on the first floor as our dog hates stairs. It was the same charming decor and it had its own living room, bathroom and full kitchen. Our dog had a bed with a huge bone awaiting her. The real surprise was the big deck outside that\u2019s just steps away from the beautiful Trout river. The babbling of the river was so relaxing!! There was even a fire pit, where we later had wine and star-gazed. We were there in April and it was 65-70 during the day, although Jay Peak ski resort (10 minutes away) was still running. The serenity of the town made you feel so relaxed and disconnected (no cell phone service)-it was great to just breathe. There are nice areas to explore and walk your dog. For dinner the first night, we strolled across the street to Bernie\u2019s. Don't let the outside fool you! There is more room in the back and the food was wonderful (they had homemade mushroom soup our night!) we ordered the swordfish and chicken marsala...Breakfast, the next morning, hosted and made by the wonderful Emmie and Karen was amazing with local blueberry pancakes and veggie bacon for me and the real stuff for the fianc\u00E9.  He had planned a photography tour for that morning; this was done by a local man, Keith who knew all of the hidden nooks, crannies, covered bridges and waterfalls, giving a perfect opportunity to take some natural pictures. He was great and would stop for anything\u2026I would see something  while we were driving and he would put it in reverse and go right back to it\u2026if even just a street sign. We had a blast with him. Later, we found out that we could\u2019ve taken our dog, but she got to rest in her suite and Jenny took her for a walk while we were out.  My next surprise was for dinner\u2026We walked to the main house to get directions (or so I thought)\u2026The table was all set with candles and the works. We had the private chef\u2019s dinner!! Jenny was our private chef and she helped my fianc\u00E9 pick out a perfect menu!! Yum yum yum! We finished the meal with the most amazing chocolate lava cake ever!! We got to talk with Jenny and had the whole place to ourselves (they only do one private dinner per night) So many thanks to Jenny!!! The owners, John and Jay were out of town and she and the girls did a fantastic job of making everything perfect.  The next day, after another spectacular breakfast, we drove up to the base of Jay Peak.

This B & B was recommended to her and she thought we should check it out.  She and I have a curious interest in the paranormal so we stayed in the \""red room\"".  Nothing scary, but one night my friend did feel as if her hair was being played with as she tried to sleep.  I could have slept through anything the beds are SO comfy!\n\n#1 The B & B:\nThis place is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!  The owners do a FANTASTIC job of decorating and have flowers and plants EVERYWHERE!  My friend and I spent two days just reading in the gazebo, as it has screening so the mosquitos could not get us.  \n\nWe were sore from a hike so we decided to sit in the hot tub for awhile.  Got in about 9 p.m., turned on the lights and the jets and sat and listened to NOTHING!  It was so quiet and peaceful, the grounds are beautiful and we could just relax.\n\nOne day we were the only guests so Jay, one of the owners, took us for a tour of the carriage house.  They have turned a barn into four separate bedrooms, two of which have two bedrooms each.  If I had not walked up there myself I would have sworn I was in a 5 star, swanky hotel!  They were absolutely gorgeous!\n\nThey also own the home which sits directly behind the Inn.  This house backs up to the river and has a fire pit to sit around on those chilly evenings.  Again, beautiful landscaping, peace and quiet!  Did I mention that they are also dog friendly?  Another couple arrived the day before we were leaving with a 60 lb boxer mix.  He was having a blast running through the river behind their suite.\n\nWe stayed in the main house, which is decorated with antiques (most of which are for sale).  They have a beautiful dining room with four separate tables & a computer and printer that guests are welcome to use.  There is a sitting room with a fireplace, snacks, coffee and soda (alcohol is also available for an extra charge)  You can make a phone call to anywhere in the world (FREE) and they have free high-speed internet!\n\nHungry?  This B & B has AWESOME breakfasts!  We had french toast with berry topping, waffles with apple crisp, omelets made with local cheese, crepes etc.  Every morning is a different \""main course\"" which included sausage and bacon, toast (and pretty much whatever else you may desire)  They also have cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit available every day!  Again, 5 star hotel quality but tastes like grandma made it just for you!\n\nThe enclosed front porch is filled with information on things to do while you are there!  We went on an easy hike, saw a beautiful waterfall, visited various shops, whose owners are personal friends of the Jay & John.  We also visited a farm (about 15 minutes away) where we sampled home-made cheeses, purchased goats milk soap & tasty treats and then got to go out and pet the goats.  (The chickens were a little jealous, as were the cows!)  We then went into Enosberg Falls and met the very sweet Laurie who owns a metaphysical store.  Just happened it was her first day open in her new shop.  Chatted with her for over an hour!  When we got back walked across the street to Bernie's for dinner, (ate there 3 separate times!)  Another family owned, local establishment with people who make you feel like you have known them for years.\n\nOn my friends birthday we had dinner at The Black Lantern (5 minute drive).  More upscale, great service and wonderful food!  She was very happy with her birthday dinner!\n\nDriving up into the mountains is gorgeous!  Everything is green, green, green!  Stopped in part of the park (which crosses the road) to enjoy the cool air and poke around in the caves and crevices along the side of the road.  It is so beautiful up there you forget how long you have been in the car!  Make sure you have a full tank of fuel in case you get carried away.  LOL\n\nBack at the Inn:\nThe people who help make this all possible are fantastic!  (Thank you so much for the homemade cookies Jenny)  John & Jay have done a wonderful job in creating a gorgeous environment and making you feel at home!  Honestly they work together as one big family and treat you as if you have been away on a long trip and now you are finally home.  I CANNOT express how much we enjoyed our stay with them!  Everything is so pretty and well maintained, you think they must be completely OCD.  Then you sit and talk with them and realize how absolutely down to earth they are!  \n\nI am so happy that we found this place and were able to have a relaxing vacation.

The 10+ hour drive to get to the Phineas Swann was well worth it!  We stayed in the River House Black Bear Suite and were quite happy there.  It's nice because it's private and if you don't want to socialize, you don't have to, but if you want to socialize, you can go up to the main house and get fresh baked homemade cookies and brownies and share stories with the other guests and staff.  It's the perfect B&B setup!  \n\nThe sound of the river rushing behind our cabin was so peaceful and relaxing. The deck has a \""doggie door\"" so that your furry friend can be outside but safely contained, which was nice. \nI must say that my dog is a member of our family and we hate to leave her when we go on vacation - now we don't have to!  It was so very nice to bring her with us for our getaway.  She loved snuggling up with me on the very comfy bed and was perfectly happy and comfortable with her surroundings right away.  \n\nWish we'd known that you can take your dog up on the Jay Peak tram - we did a little day trip out to Jay Peak and we left the pup behind as we didn't think she'd be welcome.  The Chapel and Gallery at Dog Mountain were really cool - definitely something to see if you're a dog-lover.  We found out that Vermont has to be one of the most dog-friendly places on the planet - even in Burlington at the Church Street Marketplace, there are loads of shops you can bring your dog into.  This was truly a wonderfully dog-friendly experience from start to finish!\n\nThe town grocery store had everything we needed and it was just a couple of minutes to walk there.  The pizza that we ordered from the little place across the road was the best pizza we've ever had (and CRAZY cheap)!!! Can't wait to get back and order pizza again!  We went to Raven Ridge Farm to get Maple Syrup from Olga - grade A dark vermont maple syrup....YUMMY!  The covered bridges in Montgomery are really something to see - worth driving around and finding them - the craftsmanship and old wood are just beautiful!!!\n\nDarren and Lynne have thought of everything!  We were well stocked with everything we needed and the food was absolutely fabulous!  There's a Keurig in the room so that you can make coffee\u002Ftea\u002Fcider\u002Fhot chocolate, whenever you wanted, which was lovely.  The breakfasts at the Inn were awesome - especially those WAFFLES!  (a note to Darren and Lynne:  We really want the chef to post her recipe for the apple cinnamon waffles so we can make them at home!!!)\n\nWe also had Thanksgiving dinner at the Inn and they were SO gracious and accommodating of my dietary needs with a very yummy (but HUGE!) vegetarian lasagne and the wickedest tomato basil soup made with fresh basil right out of their own garden.  \n\nOur only complaint is that this place is so far away from us!  We'll definitely be returning!  Hopefully sooner rather than later.

Jay and John took us on a quick tour before we settled into the Honeymoon Suite, which came with its own fridge and Keurig machine, as well as reliable wireless internet and free landline calling anywhere in the U.S. (a plus, as there is no cell phone or Blackberry service in the area). Our room had a jacuzzi tub, but we never used it--the hot tub on the deck behind the main house was just too inviting! When we weren't enjoying the amenities, we explored the town--a large stream runs behind the property and ample trails used for hiking, snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are just a two-minute walk away.\n\nEvery time we went to the main house for breakfast (or a snack, or just to drink the free hot cocoa with marshmallows in front of the roaring fire), Karen and Emmy--two of the B&B's friendly housekeepers--seemed to materialize out of thin air to say hello and make sure our every need was tended to, making sure that I (the vegetarian) had plenty of choices and my girlfriend (the meat lover) got an extra side of bacon. They even recommended a local sledding hangout, since we'd planned to take a slide or two with the dog in tow!\n\nJay and John made us reservations with the local masseuse, Nicole (who was heavenly) and made our Valentine's Day dinner reservations at an upscale restaurant in town which was famous for its V-Day dinner.

Not a lot of room for ski gear or closet space but we managed to tuck our bags along the wall in front of the bed.  There was space in the outer hallway that both rooms shared for boots etc.  Across from the bathroom, there was a sofa and a nitch with a small refrigerator stock with complimentary sodas & water.  There was also a Microwave, Keurig and some snacks.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  There was a small gas stove which heated the room and had an adjustable thermostat.  It would turn on in the middle of the night which could awake you if you are light sleeper or sensitive to light.  \nThe Green Mountain Suite had a nice sitting area with gas stove\u002Ffireplace and TV.  This suite had plenty of room with a second bedroom with 2 twin beds.  The only thing I noticed was that the wall between the 2 bedrooms was open at the ceiling so if you had people sleeping in each room privacy might be an issue because of talking and lights being on.  \nThere is an outdoor hot tub to relax in after a long day of XC skiing which we enjoyed with light snow falling.  We cleaned the snow from the cover ahead of time so it would be faster to jump in since it was around 10 degrees.

I knew their reputation for great service and high-end amenities, but what impressed me most about my stay was how down to earth and comfortable this inn is.  Many of the luxury inns I have visited attract clientele who like to 'dress for dinner' and hear things like \""Would the lady care for a glass of wine while she waits?\"" (addressing me in the third person, which frankly I find a little unsettling). Not so at the Phineas Swann.  Yes, I slept in an elegantly decorated room (the Blue Room in the Main Inn) with 600 thread count linens, ate a delicious gourmet breakfast of black raspberry stuffed French toast, enjoyed tea from the Keurig brewer in the living room while listening to Vissi d\u2019Arte (Jay later told me he adjusts the music to the tastes of his in-house guests \u2013 everything from classical to classic rock), and helped myself to a midnight snack from the goodies that are available 24 hours a day, yet not once did I feel anything but comfortable in this luxurious atmosphere.  John, Jay, and their wonderfully attentive staff have created a place where the ordinary traveler can enjoy the finest things without all the pretentiousness that usually goes along with upscale travel.\n  \nThe town of Montgomery Center is really charming (I mean that in a great way).  A short walk from the inn, I found the local pizza parlor, ordered a pizza and ate outside while watching the world go by. There\u2019s a wonderful store, Mountain Fiber Folk Cooperative, right across the street from the Phineas Swann that has local honey, handmade soaps, and locally produced wools and yarns.  Don\u2019t miss the honey \u2013 after tasting it, I wish I had bought more.\n\nAlthough I was in the area for a business meeting, I understand that Jay Peak is only 8 miles away and the town of Montgomery is near to all kinds of summer and winter recreation.

The rooms and common areas are decorated with a flair for detail and thematic value.  The rooms in the hotel, to be fair are maybe a bit undersized--, dwarfed by the four poster.  We asked for a change from the Red Room to the Green Room.  The Red Room just had a very cramped feel and the window was blocked almost completely by the bed.   The rooms in the outbuildings were larger, but we prefer staying in a main house.  \n\nWe have stayed in numerous B&Bs.  This was the first time a charge for gratuity was added to our bill.  We were in a great hurry to get to a kayak tour so we could not address this issue at the time of payment.  But if you stay here be prepared to pay a total of 24% in addition to the quoted room rate.  We expected the 9% rooms and meals tax\nbut have never had a gratuity added.  We usually tip our breakfast server and the maid depending on the level of service.  But we strongly object to a 15% gratuity based on the\nentire room rate.

There were dog beds, bowls, homemade dog cookies, rawhide rollies, and huge dog towels. Our 3 LARGE dogs, Doey, Java & Bronx (2 Boxers and a 70lb English Bulldog) made themselves right at home and loved all the pampering from the staff. Doey is a 13 yr old elderly Boxer and Java is a young \""Special Needs\"" Boxer who wears a doggie diaper, the staff took unbelievable care of our dogs while we were out and did a great job with changing Java's doggie diaper. \n\nThe River House is located on the banks of Trout River with a large deck and a nice little back yard that has a fire pit all ready to go (they even give you wood and a dura-flame log).  Walking your dogs is a breeze, the road is very quiet, with friendly neighbors,  the river is a fun place for them to play in (and us too).  We found it very peaceful sitting on the deck and listening to to babbling of the river in the morning and at night.\n\nThe staff is amazing, Emmy & Karen served up some of the BEST breakfast items I have ever had, my husband is a basic omelet eater and Karen gladly made him omelets while I enjoyed the breakfast of the morning, you will not leave hungry or disappointed... We met Jay who is one of the owners (they were away on vacation until out last day), he joined us in the gazebo for a very nice conversation, he will gladly give you advice on the area, there is also an informative book in your room containing everything you need to know including inn & area history, restaurants, sightseeing and swimming holes. \n\nWe enjoyed our stay and felt right at home at the Phineas Swann. We have stayed at other B&B's including \""Dog Friendly\"" B&B's but nothing compares to our stay at the Phineas...

The thick terry cloth bathrobes alone made you feel totally spoiled!  And the house is quiet all the time - really a pleasure!

The \""help yourself\"" snack and beverage table helped keep us gnoshing when we hung out in one of our favorite places - sitting by the fire in the living room.  Really makes you feel right at home home immediately.\n\nThe entire staff was helpful for any local information.

Along the trail we met up with a father and son hiking team who said they were staying at this wonderful B&B in a little town called Montgomery. Following an aimless drive from North Troy, Vermont, we drove into Montgomery Center and fell in love! The Phineas Swan had available rooms to accommodate all 5 of us wet, dirty and discouraged hikers, so the experience began! The innkeepers, Jay and John have exquisite taste for details and our rooms were spacious, beautifully decorated, and equipped with every possible item a travellor might need...or even want.  A full coffee and tea service, fridge equipped with both soft drinks and fine wines, and even a gas fireplace and jacuzzi tub!  The bed and linens were soft and soooo comfortable. It was VERY hard to leave this wonderful place and head back out to the trail.  Our breakfast was sumptsous, the thickest french toast I've had ,with a drizzled berry syrup and compote of fresh fruit.  Coffee, tea, cocoa, wine and homemade cookies are always available.  Jay was a true host and we felt like we were visiting as friends, not guests.  We all have decided to stay there again someday, without the wet and dirty clothes and hiking stuff. Jay, thanks for not turning us away, as we must have looked as bad as we felt! A definite highlight of this trip for us all.

I just walked in the door and couldn't wait to write this review. \n\nThe owners have literally thought of everything possible to make your stay feel like home. From the well appointed kitchen to comfortable beds and linens, we wanted for nothing during our stay. Some highlights: \n\n- Our cabin (6) was brand new. It had 2 guest rooms with queen sized beds, a huge bathroom, a spacious kitchen and dining area, and a comfortable living room with enough seating for everyone and a gas fireplace which made everything feel so cozy. \n- Big beautiful windows around the cabin so you can see out into the gorgeous landscape when you wake up in the morning. When we woke up today, there was a soft coat of snow and it felt like a fairytale\n- The kitchen has every appliance and knick knack that you would need. Seriously, they've thought of everything. Cheese grater. Wine glasses. Bottle openers. Mixing bowls. Everything. \n- DOG FRIENDLY!!!! It was so nice to bring the pups and relax. And they provided us with dog bowls and mats, poop bags, and some locally made treats. We popped the dog beds (bring your own dog bed) in front of the fireplace and our dogs spent most of the weekend there. Happy campers. \n- Hiking trails, leading to a beautiful waterfall! There are a few miles of trails out back. \n- The grounds are well kept, and there are adirondak chairs throughout the property. \n- The bathroom was out of a spa, I swear. It was huge, with big fluffy towels and organic shampoo\u002Fconditioner\u002Fbody wash, as well as a washer and dryer in the unit. \n- The owners are just wonderful. Christine went out of her way to accommodate us and even set up a pack and play for us in one of the rooms. She also let me borrow some olive oil for cooking when I realized we forgot to bring some. \n- Booking is a cinch on their website, and I believe that at least 3 of the cabins are dog friendly. \n\nMorrisville is a quiet town with a fabulous corner store (that has a bakery and a deli as well as beer and wine). There are 2 breweries within a 6 mile drive. There's also a plaza with a pizza place (Hogies, food was excellent) and a Hannaford in town too.

It is cozy, comfortable, accommodating and SO clean! They are so dog friendly, but entering the cabins you would never know any dogs had been there.

Very comfy king size bed as well. The cabins sit in a secluded area, down a long dirt road, with some great views on the way. There are miles of trails all around the property, where dogs can roam off leash... think our black lab enjoyed the hikes more than we did.

We picked up groceries and just enjoyed the porch and bbq grill for most meals.  Muddy Moose has everything you could ever need.... even treats, bowls and poop bags for the dogs!  Christine and Chuck are fabulous hosts and extremely helpful and kind. You can tell they love what they do. Christine even went out of her way to help my boyfriend in (sneaking) picking up a small birthday cake for me from a local bakery.

Well, that definitely didn't happen at the Moody Moose. Wow - it's hard to list all of the reasons why we loved this place.\n\nFirst, the owners are the most accommodating proprietors I've ever encountered. They were responsive, helpful, resourceful and friendly when we needed them, but gave us plenty of space to enjoy ourselves. The beginning of the great experience came with their 'Stock the Basics' program, where you tell them the essentials - like bread, milk, coffee - and they have them waiting for you.\n\nThe cabin was beautiful and we immediately felt at home. They have filled it with quality furnishings throughout and you can definitely tell it. It was spotless and had everything we needed. The kids loved their rooms and we absolutely loved the master suite on the second floor. As it's pet friendly, our dog loved being able to run out the door and explore in the area behind the cabin.\n\nThe location is a bit removed from many of the local attractions, but we preferred this. It was a week of relaxation, enjoyment and hiking that felt like an oasis from our usual busy lives. \n\nI can't say enough positive things about this property.

They allowed us to check in a bit earlier and that was very helpful given that we were driving for hours coming from NY. When we arrived at Muddy Moose Christine was there to greet us and she was very friendly and sweet. The pictures on this site and their website serve no justice as to how beautiful the cabins were. I would refer to it as  the 3 C's: Cozy, Clean, and Comfortable! I am very very very picky when it comes to cleanliness and when we arrived it was spotless. \nThe front door has a code that you use to enter, which is good so that you don't have to worry about losing your room key.  There are hooks to hang your coats and a track to put your boats on after coming in from the snow. There are games in the living room and a fire place. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need to cook as if you were at home and everything was in perfect condition. The bathroom has heated floors, extra towels, shampoo, soap, and conditioner with a washer and dryer! (AMAZING!) The bedroom has a spacious closet and comfortable bed. The only thing that I wish they had was a down comforter. But that's just a personal preference. \nEach cabin is walking distance away from one another which is perfect if you have friends staying in other cabins like we did ( we booked 4 of their 7 cabins that weekend). This location wasn't far away from Stowe so we were able to go skiing during the day and come back and enjoy our cozy cabin at night.

The Muddy Moose is located at the very end of a 2-mile dirt road, and has nearly 168 acres of property.  The log cabin we stayed in (#4) was perfect for our two daughters, as each of them got their own twin bed.  The cabin itself was gorgeous--gleaming hardwood floors with radiant heating that kept the cabin warm day and night, a full kitchen with every appliance one might need on vacation, and a very comfortable living room.  The cabins also have a gas stove, which keeps the cabin warm and toasty.  It was hard to ever want to leave the cabin!  The property itself is outstanding--miles and miles of trails to hike, ski, and run on, and one of the most beautiful waterfalls I've ever seen.  The Muddy Moose is located just 10 miles north of Stowe, but our family enjoyed the cabin so much that we were  torn between visiting Stowe and staying home and enjoying the beautiful space!  Morrisville is located just 3 miles away from the cabin, and has two amazing breweries and a great barbecue place.

data\ca\57327\2579449\551272737.html,Muddy Moose,"""When you love your stay somewhere so much and you don\u2019t know where to begin?!\n\nThat\u2019s how my husband and I felt about Muddy Moose! In fact, for my husband\u2019s first experience at a cabin... I may have ruined him forever! But seriously though! \n\nOk! Let\u2019s start with Chuck and Christine!  They were incredible hosts overall, very easy to communicate with prior to our stay also. They were very knowledgeable about the area and welcomed feedback to pass on to other guests. They were not only helpful and kind, but overall just nice human beings. \n\nWe didn\u2019t really need to ask them for anything really, especially because every tiny detail was thought of in this beautiful location, but I\u2019m sure they would have gladly helped us in anyway if we needed. In fact, we did get lost snowshoeing in the back trails and Chuck walked down to show us where to go! They were so friendly and pleasant to chat with and available for any information you need by email or stop at the front house to ask and they most likely know what your best options are. We did do that a few times and they had great suggestions. \n\nAlso, our dog Charlie took quiet a liking to them and when he interacted with them-he couldn\u2019t decided who he wanted to pet him first and just went back and forth to both of them. \uD83E\uDD2D\n\nOk, now that I\u2019ve gushed over our hosts, let\u2019s move on to the area, grounds and ofcourse the beautiful cabins! \n\nFirstly, be forewarned ahead of time that if you are travelling to Stowe\u002FMorrisville by vehicle in the winter as we did, the roads although easy to travel on-I found, are also not for the faint of heart in the dark or during a storm. I\u2019ve got lots of experience  driving in weather like this, being Canadian an all, so I wasn\u2019t really affected by it. The roads and grounds are well-maintained and cleared with each passing snowfall and with some time and an all-terrain vehicle you will feel quite comfortable after a few times on the road. \n\nMuddy Moose is easily accessible from the main highway 100 that leads directly into Stowe area. It is very easy to get to and from Stowe\u002FWaterbury area from Muddy Moose, with a quick 15 minute drive from Stowe Main St. And about 20-40 to everything else, but the best part is that you also get the feeling of being in the middle of no where when your in your cabin surrounded by mountains and peaceful trails! Not a sound was heard and with a fire and a beautiful wood cabin to settle in, you really get the best of both worlds! \n\nThe grounds were just beautiful in the winter, so peaceful and serene. Undoubtedly, I\u2019m positive that it would be beautiful no matter what time of year. The grounds are fully equipped with trails that lead to a waterfall outlook. I do suggest renting your own snowshoes for the day and exploring, as we did. Chuck keeps the grounds and trails groomed for a nice hike with your pup also if your into that. We truly enjoyed the beauty of the grounds and they were very well maintained! The front desk is a quaint and cozy house with a beautiful view as well, there are maps and Muddy Moose branded items for purchase in the main area. We did in fact purchase some mugs that we will drink our morning coffee from and think fondly on our time at Muddy Moose. \n\nThe Moose Lounge was a beautiful and quaint edition to our stay. Just steps from our cabin we had access to pool table, shuffle board, chess table, arcade games etc. The Moose Barn was equally well appointed, with a fire place, bathroom, beautiful and interesting decor, information and pamphlet on things to do in the area. My husband and I took advantage and enjoyed playing some pool, knowing we were steps from our cabin, so it was easy to make a beverage and not worry about driving! Great editions guys!!! \uD83D\uDC4F\uD83C\uDFFC\uD83D\uDC4F\uD83C\uDFFC\n\nNow last but definitely not the least!!!! OUR CABIN!!! \n\nEach beautiful log cabin, has a parking space and a gorgeous view...but I think ours had the best view of Mount Mansfield! The parking space and deck were groomed and well cared for by Chuck, even early Christmas Day morning as we laid in bed watching the snow fall, we heard Chuck out there shovelling! Thanks Chuck! It snowed a lot that day and the roads were also groomed! \n\nThe interior of our cabin was so so gorgeous! Vaulted high ceilings, big fans to circulate the air, would be perfect in the summer! Wood interior from bottom to top, all hand crafted by owners and the Love and details that went into the cabin were very apparent! Working gas fireplace with timer is super cozy on a cold winter morn, especially on Christmas or coming in from winter activities. Our dog was very comfy in the cabin as well and really relaxed during our stay. They even had dog bowls, a toy and some other dog friendly amenities waiting on our arrival, which was a very thoughtful touch. \n\nThere is beautiful view of the mountain and forest from anywhere you stand in the cabin, lots of natural light coming from each room. We really enjoyed the view! The whole cabin made us feel right at home!The cabin was perfect for just us, anything bigger would have been to much I think. \n\nLiving room was cozy and had a comfy couch perfect for two and a nice chair by the window to read. The kitchen was fully equipped with any cookware, glasses etc. and anything that you may need. You will need to bring your own, coffee, butter, groceries etc. which is expected when staying in a cabin. There was dishwasher, which we don\u2019t haven at home and laundry service right in the bathroom, as well as the soaps you may need for these. The bathroom was huge, as was the shower! Very roomy! Nice shower head and good water flow. \n\nOur bedroom was very cozy as well, it\u2019s equipped with a TV, ceiling fan, beautifully decorated and cozy, all you could need to during your stay including iron etc. is there. My only complaint to be honest was the pillows. The bed was comfy but my hubby and I both had a hard time sleeping on those pillows. Some serious kinks in both our necks and some tough sleeps. But-considering every other detail they have thought of, that\u2019s my only suggestion (some better pillows) would have completed everything. That\u2019s literally my only complaint. And I\u2019m pretty picky! \n\nOh also... TV is equipped to plug your laptop into it, which we did to watch some movies we had on the laptop. Wifi is really not very good, but... your in a cabin turn your phone off and enjoy playing some games. Also a few in the cabin. \n\nI promise by the end of your trip, you\u2019ll wish you didn\u2019t have to leave. I know we did! And we will be back! We miss it already! \n\nHUGE THANKS to Chuck and Christine for the very memorable stay and Muddy Moose and our best Christmas yet! Your love and passion for Muddy Moose is very apparent! Thank-you for sharing it with us!\n\nWe really look forward to another stay and ofcourse seeing you again! Until then, we will fondly remember our trip to Vermont for Christmas and always remember Muddy Moose! \n\nBest Christmas ever!

They both curled up by the gas fireplace and took many snoozes.   \n       The cabin is immaculate.   Granite countertops, beautiful cabinetry, vaulted ceilings, laundry in the bathroom, impressive spacious bathroom,  nice king sized comfy bed, well organized silverware and a gated farmers porch.

We got a bit lost on the trails but the dogs ran around in the snow and couldn't have cared less.\n      Chuck and Christine were such awesome hosts.

It had large rocking chairs on the porch and a very comfortable shower with plenty of hot water.  The view off the the distant mountains was dreamy and I experienced some amazing sunsets.  Cabin is state of the art and pristine in cleanliness.  I was visiting solo but checked out the recreation cabin.  It was fun just seeing all the gaming options and there is a take a book, drop a book area.  What impressed me the most was all the games that required coin input, the proceeds are donated to the local food bank!   The peacefulness of the property cannot be overstated.

data\ca\57327\2579449\688055923.html,Muddy Moose,"""I use trip advisor all the time. I have never written a review before but felt compelled to write one here. I booked the Muddy Moose for a weekend getaway for my family based on all the great reviews. Live in the hustle and bustle of NJ suburbia so was looking forward to a getaway.  Arrived at the Muddy Moose and was very nicely greeted by the hosts, then was asked how I wanted to settle up. Have vacationed throughout this great country and have never been asked how I was going to settle up when I just arrived. Was a little taken back. I guess I know why because I never saw them again. Certainly aren\u2019t out and about keeping up the grounds as there is no landscaping, no flowers, no hanging baskets, place void of color!! Fake flowers on the sign. Tacky, really for such a beautiful location.  The cabin inside is beautiful!!!! Though no airconditioning!!!It was a lot hotter there than at home in NJ. Couldn\u2019t enjoy being at the cabin in the day at all, had to wait until the sun went down to even be there. Even then was still uncomfortable as there were no fans in the windows to bring the outside air in. What I found to be very strange is the owners put air conditioning in the game barn but not in the cabins. So they must be aware of the need for air conditioning. Didn\u2019t want to spend my time in the game barn. If you want to play pac-man it will cost you!!! Even a portable room air conditioner would have made it more bearable in the cabin. The website makes these cabins look private. Private they are not!  With 168 acres of property our cabin was literally adjacent to our neighbors cabin. Much closer than my neighbor here in NJ. They could see in our window if I didn\u2019t have the curtain drawn. The neighbor on the other side was close enough I could hear their entire conversations. Didn\u2019t really feel like I \u201Cgot away.\u201D They have a fire pit but you have to get the supplies to start a fire in the morning. Who thinks about that in the morning? Oh and that will cost $10 for firewood, really? Should have chopped some trees down in the backyard because they all obstructed my Mountain View. Mountain View shouldn\u2019t be advertised if there isn\u2019t one. Find a way to incorporate the $10 firewood into the cost of running the place. Either make this place full service or make it bring your own supplies somewhere in between comes off tacky. Would never go in the cold months because they have detailed instructions about the heat and how it can\u2019t be set above a certain temperature or you will get charged more. They even can control your heat from their I phone. Fireplace is on a timer so that won\u2019t keep you warm. They should have installed wood burning stoves they would have heated those little cabins wonderfully. They are using radiant heat from the floor as the sole source of heat. I have that here in my house, and while it helps keeps me warm I still have my heater or my wood burning stove,and I\u2019m sure it gets a lot colder there than in NJ. They tell you in their booklet how to dress to stay warm(good thing). Well I hate to write all this but I rely on trip advisor a lot, and rely on other\u2019s honest reviews.

On the buffet table there is a yogurt parfait with berries and granola in individual cups, fresh fruit, their own granola bars (very tasty, soft and made with honey.  The 1st day they had orange\u002Fcranberry scones and the 2nd day there was a berry muffin.  \nThere is also orange juice and apple juice and they serve you coffee and tea.  \n\nWe ate at their restaurant once in the evening for dinner and it all was very scrumptious. First we were served a delicious focaccia bread with herb olive oil.  I had a grilled chicken with peach salad $20 - snipped greens, corn, roasted red peppers, crispy hominy grits, with a peach vinaigrette.  My husband had the special which was a shredded chicken with homemade noodles in a sauce, not sure of the name of it.  The apple\u002Fpear fritter we had for dessert was divine. \n\nOur waiter Peter was very friendly.

The setting is gorgeous, the buildings are charming - inside and out. The view down towards the pool (did not know  they had one) and the lake was lovely. We were shown to our room (gorgeous) and the hostess showed us how to light the fire (too hot unfortunately to need it but I am sure it is lovely in cooler times).  The bed was very comfy and the whole room was very well equipped - but no coffee making facilities in the room. The bathroom was vey elegant and the toiletries were lovely. We headed to the bar for an early evening drink and things started to unravel. The bar is lovely and looks very professional - they have some in-house special cocktails listed on the drinks menu. However hubby fancied a simple bloody mary. The girl at the bar looked slightly baffled - disappeared  for a couple of minutes - then came back with the pronouncement that they \""didn't have the mixer for that\""  Huh ?!! So we had some wine and sat on the lovely terrace. Not sure about the music that got switched on through the outdoor speakers a little later.  Went to dinner - the menu was short, not always a bad thing, but we did struggle to find something we wanted, but what we did choose tasted fine.  Not sure if they change the menu on a daily basis but if not, it would have been tricky if we had been staying a second night. Breakfast was very disappointing. There was some simple yoghurt and fresh fruit on a side table - nice. However when it came to hot choices we were asked if we wanted bacon and eggs - how would we like our eggs cooked? I am not a fan of eggs so I asked for something like French toast or a waffle or a pancake with my bacon.....No was the reply. Not sure how making a bit of French toast is more complicated than an omelette ! Hubby had the bacon & scrambled eggs - small portion, not great. I thought I might try the baked goods....the croissants were about 2 inches long and rock hard (as were the cinnamon rolls). Coffee was good, we were never offered a top up though and ended up just helping ourselves. It seemed to us as though the weekend wedding party, commencing later that afternoon, appeared to have taken precedence over everything else.

First off as we drove into Edson Hill, we were very excited, the grounds are beautiful and it all looked lovely.  We were shown to our room and it all looked perfect.  We had dinner booked that night at the restaurant and walked the short distance down.  It was very busy.  We ordered our drinks which took a little while to come but no worries, then we finished those and ordered a second round.  The food was a little slow coming, it took over an hour, but it was nice when it arrived.  It was clear that the hotel and restaurant were at capacity.  That night we came back and lit a fire.  It was so cozy.\nNext morning it snowed and the grounds looked even better.  We went off for the day skiing.  We came back that night and were getting ready to go out when the room filled with smoke.  Anyway this happened twice while we were there, I think there was (is) problem with the flue in our room.  We also had some issues with the bathroom which was a little troublesome.  As the hotel was at capacity they couldn't move us so we ended up sleeping with the window open (bearing in mind it was snowing).  However, the beds have the thickest duvets I have ever seem so I was fine, my son near the window was a little chilly though.  The cleaning staff, although lovely were stretched and were still in our room after we got back from skiing, the second night we went to the tavern and restaurant they were clearly really busy and things I requested couldn't be fulfilled. \nWithout going on and on, I think the owners have done a great job with this place.  With a bit more work it will be amazing.  My hit list would be to get our room (13) checked out. Always have a plan B, what if it had been something worse, at busy times like this, get more trained staff to help in the restaurant\u002Ftavern\u002Frooms.  For when it quietens down, think about tea\u002Fcoffee making facilities in the room or a way that the guests can access this and other snacks outside of the breakfast times.  Make the breakfast menu a little more flexible.  I am gluten free and was fine with the platter but couldn't eat the pancakes, french toast or pastries.  There wasn't always yogurt\u002Fberries on offer.  \nHaving said all this, I have still given them 4 stars.  This place will go from strength to strength.  The owners seem really genuine and nice.  They have done a fab job with the decor and the grounds.  Also when I came to discuss the issues they were more than gracious and we came to an amicable solution.  \nGood luck for the future Edson Hill.  I hope you will take this review with the spirit in which it is intended.",4,positive,"January 3, 2017",1500 Edson Hill Rd,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4180

We have two young children, ages 5 and 6.\n\nThe property is lovely, with terrific views of the valley. We were there in winter with full snow, and I suspect it just gets prettier come summer. We did not partake of any of the cross country or other activities on campus, but the property looks extensive and the trails well maintained.\n\nAfter spending the last 3 PDW at the Stowe Mountain Lodge we decided to try something different. We learned about Edson Hill on TripAdvisor through the reviews. We booked a single room with two queen beds as no suites were available. We were in room # 16, which is part of one of the out buildings. The room was well appointed, larger than anticipated, had a small desk that was a bit cramped if your intention was to work at it but sufficient as a place to put your wallet, and use as a charging station. The room had a wood burning fire place, with plenty of firewood. The bathroom we very modern with a walk in shower and radiant heating in the floors. It appeared as if the cottage was recently built. Linens and pillows were comfortable. The cottage was an easy walk to the Manor House, the main building with the Tavern and Restaurant.\n\nThe staff at check-in, and check-out was fabulous. Breakfast was delicious, and when we wanted to depart early to get to the mountain, they prepared to go baskets for us to eat on the way to the mountain. For the most part the staff appeared to be very engaged in their jobs, interested in the clients, and in the success of the business. Their attitude alone added to the positive experience.\n\nThe Tavern, which is the bar beneath the restaurant in the Manor House, is a nice spot, although with limited seating. We had drinks one evening, and the bartender \u002F server was fantastic with our children. We also had dinner one night, which was a bit of a disaster. Apparently a 16 top ordered dinner in the restaurant ahead of us and the wheels came off the bus... 1.5 hours for buttered noodles and grilled cheese! That said, the restaurant owned it, the staff was apologetic, and they appropriately addressed the situation at the end of the meal without the slightest prompting. \n\nThe Inn is about 7 miles from the base of Stowe, which is a very easy drive. However, it is not walkable to the Stowe Mountain Shuttle, the Inn does not offer a shuttle of its own, and the mountain currently has a lack of parking, so if you there to ski on a busy holiday or weekend you need to leave for the mountain early.\n\nAll in all I would definitely return, especially if they offered a shuttle service to and from the mountain.",4,positive,"February 23, 2017",1500 Edson Hill Rd,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4180

The maple syrup bread pudding was out of this world. And I don't know what they feed Vermont pigs, but that was the BEST bacon I have ever eaten. Avery greeted us at those delicious breakfasts and made sure we had what we needed. She also packed up a few carrots for this horse lover to feed the Edson Hill horses (who were also very well taken care of).\n\nThe location was great.

The waitress also seemed to rushed that she missed quite a lot of detail as to what you could actually order - we only realised on the third day that a parfait was available.   There didn't seem to be enough staff for the number of guests.  On one afternoon we asked for a pot of tea.  There is no area in the hotel where you could help yourself to tea and coffee (which seemed unusual compared to other hotels on our trip).  You therefore had to ask the receptionist to fetch the tea and she looked rather put out.  On pouring the tea, we found we had two pots of hot water with no tea bag in sight!! The next day we heard them advising another guest that they had no tea at all.    On the third day when there were less guests breakfast it was much better.   \n\nOur room was stifling hot because the window would not open.

What hasn't changed is the magnificent property, excellently decorated \""guest house\"" rooms and beautiful restaurant overlooking snow-clad terrain.\n\nOur first stay, last February, was so near perfect we considered no other options.  This time we faced several issues -- real problems -- that may preclude future visits to an inn we thought would be ours for many years to come.\n\n1) After repeated representations regarding a flexible rebooking policy in the event of last-minute weather-driven cancellation, management emailed us we would forfeit all our money if we didn't show (when the weather forecast called for daytime temperatures near -20 for the majority of our 3-day ski trip).  To its credit, management was professional and apologetic when we arrived, but took no steps to make it up to us (not even a token gesture like a bottle of cheap champagne).\n\n2) There really is no front desk, other than a computer and a chair near the entryway, often unoccupied.  As a practical matter, you just get the feeling the place is on autopilot, but no one is there to address your concerns, if any.  At 7 AM there was no coffee in the facility (and the rooms have none), so I had to knock on the kitchen door and ask for some.\n\n3) Despite the magnificent dining room, the breakfasts were average and not particularly plentiful.  Each day there was *one* baked item (e.g., scone, muffin) on a tray, but that's it.  The rest was on-order, and the portions were not large.  For example, the French toast was nicely displayed with raspberry drizzle on a nice plate, but tasted rather boring and was dry without lots of syrup.\n\n4) The walls between rooms appear to be not very well sound-insulated (I've read this in at least one other review).  After midnight we heard a full broadcast (an interview with Darryl Strawberry) from our neighbors and, much as I grew up a die-hard Met fan, this was no treat.\n\n5) Probably the biggest problem was that there was some sort of backflow from the fireplace, rendering the rooms heavily smokey when neighboring units lit their fireplaces.  (I should note that I suffer from severe allergies.)  When we first checked in, we could barely stand the stench in the room (we're not talking about that slightly smokey aroma in any room with a wood-burning fireplace).  We were transferred to another room, which was good for the first night because the neighbors had not yet checked in.  But once they did and lit up their fireplace, our room was again smokey in no time.  We had no choice but to open the windows (in sub-zero temperatures) and light up our own fireplace to draw the air back up and out of our room, then close the windows and snuggle under the warm blankets the rest of the chilly night -- not a first-class experience.  In the morning I overheard another guest informing the manager of the very same problem in their room, so this is no isolated episode.\n\nAll in all, it almost breaks my heart to have to write a [somewhat] negative review, because the place has so much charm and potential.

Wow!   What a welcome from owners Mary Anne and George:  from the minute we arrived (Union Jack proudly unfurled beside the Stars and Stripes) to when they waved us off on our way back to Montreal, we were cosseted, entertained, informed and fed to Five Star Plus levels.   \n\nWhere to begin?   In a nutshell, this is high-end inn accommodation where every detail has been thought about, and where the proprietors give unerringly expert, unfailingly constant attention to guests.   Yet it is refreshingly homely:  we were struck by their genuine friendliness \u2013 and indeed that of the other guests, hailing as they did from all over the States (yet with a steady flow of fellow Brits and a goodly smattering of mainland Europeans).   Conversations with fellow travellers were readily struck up, everyone swopping holiday stories and offering tips -  reminding us of the old adage, that strangers are simply friends you haven\u2019t met yet.   \n\nMary Anne has an encyclopaedic grasp of the locality, and is happy to dispense advice, suggestions, maps and guide books to suit all tastes and activities, often spending time after breakfast to brief guests on their chosen outing that day.   She\u2019ll even book a restaurant for you.   And speaking of breakfast\u2026   Forget the diet!   George cooks everything fresh:  pancakes, waffles, omelettes, the best quiche we\u2019ve ever eaten, pumpkin bread, maple-cured (what else?) bacon \u2013 the list goes on.   Our taste buds exploded with shock and awe, and our waistlines ballooned in the nicest possible way.   It was all so good we ate it twice - as we were there for two weeks!   (An interesting byline\u2026   The average stay was shorter than ours, most Americans seeming to keep on the move, perhaps because their holidays were shorter, whereas we wanted a reliable base from which to tour \u2013 and of course sample the delights of the nearby Von Trapp Lodge (more of which later!)).   Self-service drinks are available from 7 am, with breakfast from 8.30, and an Afternoon Tea at 4.00, again self-service and featuring Mary Anne\u2019s delicious home-bakes.   If you wanted to stay in, she was more than happy for you to picnic in the dining room or games room, complete with fridge and coffee-maker (Shaw\u2019s supermarket is conveniently situated just along the road and caters for all but the most eclectic tastes and thirsts).   \n\nThe public rooms are elegant and plush, two of them, in fact:  a beautiful, scrumptious\nlounge and the afore-mentioned games room.   On top of this, there\u2019s a sun terrace overlooking a huge meadow and the distant Mount Mansfield (a must-do trip, either on foot for the hail and hearty, or via the scenic toll road for the more sedentary, but also enjoyable from the comforts of the Inn\u2019s hot tub).   The bedrooms are extremely spacious and comfortable.  We had a week in Spruce Peak, followed by a week in Mt Mansfield, where I had my first viewing of The Sound of Music in high-definition Blu-Ray on the room\u2019s system.   \n\nStowe itself \u2013a fifteen-minute walk away - is a pretty village:  like so much of the States, it\u2019s exactly like what you see in the movies.   It\u2019s perfectly placed for tours, visits and activities nearby and farther afield.   It has three or four good restaurants and a similar number of cafes.   If there was one slight drawback, we found the shopping experience somewhat limited (as throughout northern Vermont), not that that was high on our list of priorities.   On Columbus weekend there was a superb arts and crafts fair high up on the Mountain Road, itself bristling with hotels, inns, bars and restaurants.   Some guidebooks give the impression that it\u2019s a bit on the tacky side, but that is exaggerated.   Nor did we find the oft-mentioned traffic too much of a problem \u2013 but watch out for the infamous three-way junctions, which tend to be something of a free-for-all.   For exercise, walk the Stowe Recreation Path, about 5-6 miles up and down the valley, running parallel to the Mountain Road.\n\nWe arrived to a weekend of dismal rain \u2013 and worryingly green foliage!   Then (maybe it was our Sunday morning attendance at the Stowe Community Church, complete with bronzed preacher-man that did it) a glorious Indian summer set in, enticing us out to the meadow to sunbathe most afternoons for over a week.   Hot days and cool nights worked their magic on the trees, which changed colour daily and fulfilled their promise of kaleidoscopic treasures, reaching a peak just before we left for home.   We enjoyed many \u2018leaf-peeping\u2019drives along the highways and byways: Route 100 was wonderful for colour, so was Jay Peak.   Basically, the Fall begins in the north and works it way down through the State;  generally, the first two weeks in October are more or less guaranteed to be good, though with the world\u2019s weather seemingly on its ear, who can tell?   Two other locations stand out:  Burlington (the biggest city) with a stunning waterfront, and the diminutive capital, Montpelier, little more than a glorified village \u2013 but with the best crafts shop we encountered anywhere slap bang in the main street (and a great diner nearby).\n\nSound of Music fans will inevitably want to head for the Von Trapp Lodge, a huge Alpine-style chalet hotel set in acres of forest with stunning views, owned and run by the famous von Trapps.   We took the history tour \u2013 well worth it \u2013 which starts with a talk, takes in the family cemetery where Maria and Georg and other family members are buried, continues with an absorbing film about Maria, and ends with a Q & A session with a real von Trapp.   We were lucky to have Johannes, the youngest of the three children Maria and Georg had together (i.e. in addition to the seven to which Maria was governess).   After the tour your ticket entitles you to roam free around the estate.   They also have a great bakery down the road, where you can sample the newly-created von Trapp beers either indoors or on a small terrace overlooking the valley below, and enjoy some lightish snacks and of course, cakes!\n\nNow to the only bad bit of the trip\u2026   We had booked a birthday meal in the main restaurant at the von Trapp Lodge, billed on their website as offering fine dining, a wonderful culinary experience.   We duly arrived sporting our glad rags, only to be told by the maitre d\u2019 that the restaurant was offering buffet service only that night.   What a letdown!   The said buffet was all that one expects \u2013 and dreads \u2013 from the concept.   I made the mistake of opting for Wienerschnitzel.   Without boasting, I do know my Wienerschnitzels, from Bavaria and throughout Austria, and truly, it was the worst I\u2019d ever tasted anywhere.   Others may have had a different experience, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend it for that special meal:  far too risky!\n\nWe flew with Swiss via Zurich into Montreal, our first time with the carrier, and were seriously impressed, even in economy:  flying like it used to be thirty years ago.   Good seats, reasonably good food, good service, clean and punctual aircraft.   We had pre-booked a hire car with Hertz \u2013 excellent value at under \u00A3200 for the fortnight, a medium-sized car (automatic, of course) which came with a full tank of petrol included.   The border crossing into the US was straightforward and took less than half-an-hour.   One point which isn\u2019t generally known:  the ESTA is only required for arrivals by air and sea, but not overland, so we\u2019d actually purchased it unnecessarily.   Still, it holds good for two years, so we\u2019ll hopefully be able to use it before it expires (California here we come!).     \n\nAll-in-all, an unforgettable trip.

But the reviews swayed him to take a chance and he booked. We got a mid-tiered price room. We really felt like we got so much more than we paid for. We are pretty high maintenance when it comes to room cleanliness and bed sheets. But the moment we walked into our room, we knew we had no worries. It was so quaint, cute and the sheets were just as nice as some of the 4-stars we have stayed at. The room felt like a guest room in my mom's house (didn't have the feel of a chain hotel room).The rooms, hallway & main area all feel new and clean and bright. I also love that they asked everyone to take off their snowboots at the door and even provide boot trays. This made the place feel that much cleaner to not have to walk on dirty carpets.\n\nWe always opt for B&B's like the Brass Lantern over any regular chain hotels or even big mountain resorts due to getting the personal experience and connecting with real people. I love seeing guests mingling and lounging together in the main room by the fire into the late evening. Even the guests staying here are friendly! Really felt like I was coming home to a warm & joyful home.\n\nThe Inn Keepers definitely go out of their way, and even above and beyond to meet our needs. When we returned from the slopes, we saw Mary leaving for the evening. But when she leaned we needed an ice pack, she returned back to the house to get us one. On the morning we checked out, we had to leave extra early before breakfast was served. She surprised us with 2 amazingly delicious home baked blueberry muffins cutely packed in a to-go bag with napkins for the road... Just like mom would! \n\nThe location is perfect. Close to the mountain and all the great restaurants.\n\nWe would return to the Brass Lantern just to visit Mary Anne and George! They are the reason why we search far and wide for B&B's like this. It's not just the room and breakfast but truly for a local and warm experience.

data\ca\57415\119092\161722382.html,Brass Lantern Inn,"""We recently spent a wet, snowy late season ski weekend at the Brass Lantern.  The inn is located along Rt. 100 about a quarter mile north of the village of Stowe.  It\u2019s convenient to Stowe's shops and restaurants, but barely 30 feet off of the highway.  The interior is comfortable and spotless.  Our room was fairly large with a king bed and a gas version of a wood stove, but nowhere to hang damp ski clothes.  The bathroom had fully modernize fixtures, but as might be expected, old and troublesome plumbing.  The room had windows on two sides:  one directly facing Rt. 100 and the other looking out toward some condos across a quiet field.  It may have had a view of the mountains in the distance, but that weekend the clouds and fog never lifted high enough for us to see.  The road noise was not a problem for us since we were up early both mornings and traffic during the night is minimal.  It may be more of an issue in summertime, particularly if you plan on sleeping late.\n\nBreakfasts were a bit different than most B&B\u2019s.  Each day, there was a fixed menu consisting of a starter course and a main course.  The starters were a fruit, nut, yogurt mix the first day and an apple cobbler type dish the next.  Both were very good.  The main course the first day was an egg concoction baked in small dish that was rather rubbery and tasteless.  The next day it was a more traditional but undistinguished plate of pancakes and sausage.  Coffee, tea, and juice were available, but no alternative foods other than some packaged oatmeal.\n\nA small room off of the main entrance hall serves as a reception area.  Upon entry to the inn, you are greeted with signs on several door frames and on every table in the reception area stating that no shoes, boots or other footwear is permitted anywhere in the inn.  Considering our need to move the baggage and equipment associated with a lengthy ski trip from the snowy parking lot, through several rooms, a long hall, and steep stairs to get to our room this presented some problems.  While contemplating this, the owner appeared and immediately handed us a form to sign which said that  we would be charged another $30 per half hour if we stayed beyond 10:30 am on the day of departure.  This was not the most pleasant way to greet guests, but since we were planning on skiing both days, I did not think it would be a problem.  We signed the form and went back trying to shuffle our gear from the car to the room while minimizing our violations of the footwear rule.  On Sunday the clouds and fog had descended into the valley completely obscuring the mountain.  In addition, my wife had a painful ankle from an injury on Saturday, so we decided not to ski that day.  Although we were up early, we took our time having breakfast and packing.  After breakfast we found the plumbing in our bathroom no longer worked, requiring several painful trips downstairs by my wife to use the lower hall bathroom.  While she rested her ankle, I started shuffling our bags and gear downstairs.  By now we were approaching the 10:30 deadline. As I arrived in the reception area with the second load of gear, I see the owner moving my first load including my computer case out onto the ground of the wet snowy parking lot.  Since I was still in my stocking feet so as to not violate rule one, all I could do was ask him stop.  As I scrambled to get my boots on, his wife cheerily assured me that she would not charge me for violating rule two while trying to comply with rule one.  It all provided an awkward ending to a not very comfortable weekend.",3,negative,"May 24, 2013",717 Maple St,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4250

As it was out first time to Stowe, MaryAnn chatted with us over breakfast, giving plenty of tips for getting the most out of our ski day. Unfortunately, on our first day of skiing, my husband had a serious fall and sustained a significant lower leg fracture, landing him at Copley Hospital (about 15 minutes up the road from the Inn) for the rest of our long weekend. \n\nMaryAnn and George could not have been kinder to me during the next several stressful days; giving me great recommendations for places to eat in town that would be friendly for a single person to eat at the bar, making sure to chat and check in at breakfasts, sending me with cookies and other baked goodies to the hospital for my husband, and giving us pillows to prop up his leg on the drive home. They literally could not do too much for me. They offered to go back to the mountain and pick up our skis from Ski Patrol (where we had left them in the injury's aftermath) and offered to set him up on the couch in their game room if necessary so he did not have to tackle the stairs to the Spruce Peak guestroom where were we staying. \n\nAt many B&Bs, one member of the couple is responsible for the food and the other for the hospitality, but at Brass Lantern, it was refreshing to see MaryAnn and George sharing the hospitality role, even as George spent time in the kitchen. He made sure to talk with guests at breakfast and was as warm and friendly as his wife. And those breakfasts are absolutely wonderful! Delicious, filling, and varied. Among the best B&B breakfasts that we've experienced anywhere. \n\nOur room, Spruce Peak, was larger than I expected, but still cozy, though our plans to take full advantage of the gas fireplace and whirlpool tub were interrupted. The one downside of this room is that it is on the street side of the inn (it actually extends front to back of the entire old section of the house).

Each room has a tasteful character all its own, the most comfortable beds and linens to ensure a restful, luxurious night's sleep and all the modern conveniences. 2)The Food - As mentioned in numerous reviews, breakfast at the Brass Lantern is an occasion to celebrate. George's famous 3-course offerings are wholesome and refined, providing an excellent start to the day, while Mary Anne's Afternoon Tea features a variety of delicious baking to go with the numerous tea blends and hot chocolate available. If you happen to stay on a day when her famous almond cake is on the breakfast menu, then you are in for a real treat! 3)The Rates - Very competitive, despite the exchange on the Canadian dollar. Seasonal rates also make it possible for the budget-minded traveler to enjoy the Brass Lantern Experience at alternate times during the year. 4) The Innkeepers - What more can be said about Mary Anne and George, whose constant effort and professionalism ensure a quality product and incomparable service, all in their cheery, discreet and unpretentious manner?

After doing a lot of research it ticked all the boxes for our stay during Christmas season. \n\nThe rooms are sparkling clean, beds are super comfortable, water in shower is strong. Rooms come in all sizes depending on what you want to spend. Cozy with homemade quilts on the beds and sound proof windows. Comfy fluffy robes and some chocolate too. \n\nThe house is almost 200 years old And very well taken care of. The living room many sitting areas perfect for reading or siting in front of the fireplace that George lights daily at about 5Pm. At that time many gather and you get to meet and chat with the other guests as well as the proprietors. After a day out and about or after returning from dinner we always love to enjoy a sip of bourbon or wine while in front of the fireplace. \n\nBreakfast is great with juice, fruit cup and either savory or sweet main course. George is the chef and his recipes have been featured in a book for Ski brunches chosen from select Inns nationwide. Bacon and cheese quiche as well as blueberry waffles with their AMAZING maple syrup or their strawberry crepes are our favorites. While sitting there guests chat with each other and the dining room has a perfect view of Stowe. The only thing I would love to see is an option for a stronger pot of coffee. The brew they make is weak and Vermont offers great coffee options. For a coffee lover like myself that is the only downside for me personally. They have a fantastic separate game room with a full size community fridge, microwave and Keurig coffee maker which I used instead of the coffee they have for breakfast. \n \nWhen you walk in they ask that folks remove their wet boots and place them on plastic trays they leave for their guests. There they provide disposable slippers for those that want them. I always walked around with my thick socks which made it feel like home. \n\nFinally the location is perfect. It\u2019s a short 2 minute drive from town and on a main road so it\u2019s easy to get to. Love that they are not on Mountain Road which has lots of traffic during peak periods. With so many restaurant options in the area it\u2019s easy to explore from their location.\n\nThere are many choices in and around Stowe for lodging and at times we have thought perhaps try something else? We thought of trying an Airbnb but decided against it because we love the comunal times getting to talk to other guests in a warm an open environment; and who wants to cook first thing in the morning or do dishes while on vacation!! We also thought of staying at other B&Bs or larger hotels. But it always comes back to the hospitality of George and Mary Anne that makes this place so SPECIAL. For all of the above and more that is why we keep returning to this warm and friendly gem in Stowe. BOOK EARLY they sell out because of it.  \n\nFinally we usually drive in from Boston after visiting family. The drive is about 3.5 hours. We always break it up by stopping for lunch in Woodstock which has a charming diner. On the return we stop at Simon Pierce in Queeche to watch the glass blowers and then have lunch at their restaurant. The view is outstanding as it sits on a waterfall by the river and their is a view of a covered bridge as well. \n\nLet us know if you have any questions.

Our room was very large, had a comfy bed, plenty of room for our packs, and a clean bathroom. The best part was the mountain view and sunset we enjoyed while laying in bed.

My husband and I stayed in the tiniest room they have. They disclose the size of the room on the website and it's what I expected - very, very cozy. The bed (I think it was Full size) was VERY comfortable... the frame was a bit squeaky but it didn't take long to settle in at all. There is a large window in the room so we were able to enjoy the fresh mountain air. I can't comment on a\u002Fc (there is a window unit in the room) or the heat because we didn't need to use either during our stay. Our room was on the backside of the house facing a large yard and trees. The bathroom within our room was equally small but it was neat and clean. The only downside to the stay was that the floors in the hallway are very squeaky so you cannot miss anyone walking out in the hallway... whether you want to know if they are there or not! After being there a while it's not as noticeable unless people talk loudly or slam their doors, which happens in any hotel really. Definitely not handicap accessible. The breakfast was delicious - don't skip it! The best thing was a zucchini pineapple bread which I had never had before and it was delicious.They have a little firepit and a gazebo out back and a hot tub (which we did not use but it looked well kept). The place has plenty of books, games and movies to use if chilling out at basecamp is part of your plan. Lastly, the owners have a young golden retriever named Sophie and the innkeepers are respectful for people who don't love dogs (they don't let her run loose in the common area of the inn) but if you do, Sophie would love to fetch sticks with you in the back yard!

Very frustrating after taking a second shower of the day to follow the rules.  I believe we should have been told when we registered. There were also no homemade cookies the day we arrived.

And now under new ownership (Tom and Susan), it's even better!\n\nTimberholm is off the beaten path, which is why it took us awhile to find it, and also one of the reasons we like it.  Mountain Road is pretty busy, and by going a half mile up Cottage Club Road (which is a dead end), we arrive at complete idyllic beauty and silence.\n\nTimberholm has 10 rooms.  Our favorites are upstairs where there are 2 suites and 2 well appointed rooms.  This trip we chose one of the suites.  The rooms have all new beds, and a lot of new furniture.  The art is perfectly suited to the environment.\n\nBreakfast every day is delightful.  Depending on how many people are staying, it's a terrific way to make new friends and have interesting conversations.  The Great Room typically has people in it at any time of the day or evening, and sitting and chatting is my favorite activity.\n\nThere is an outdoor hot tub that is wonderful.  You can sit in it, and on a clear night, you can stare up at the stars.  \n\nThe view out the back of the Inn is to die for.  You can see directly across to the mountains, and when it's hot air balloon season, the balloons float right by fairly close.  It's an amazing sight.\n\nTom and Susan cultivate the attention of birds.  There are bird feeders all over, and when you are having breakfast, you can feast your eyes on humming birds, yellow finches, etc. \n\nThe Inn now has WIFI, which is helpful to me as I always bring my laptop on trips. \n\nOur favorite activity in Stowe is bicycling on the recreation path.  There is plenty of room at Timberholm to store your bikes, and if you ride down the hill, you can join the path right there.\n\nTom and Susan are delightful.  Debbie and I had some really fun conversations with them.  They moved from Orlando Florida to brave the cold.  Now THAT's commitment.  They are so accommodating.  Whatever you want, they will do their best.  Debbie always gets up late, so Tom provided me with a tray and breakfast so I could bring it to her.  That's service above and beyond.\n\nThere is a game room in the cellar which has a large selection of tapes and DVD's and a TV, so if you bring your kids, they will have something to do.\n\nWhat else can I say?

After a day of traveling and sightseeing it was so nice to come back to such a relaxing place. We will defiantly pass on this recommendation to family and friends.!!",5,positive,"August 8, 2009",452 Cottage Club Rd,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4294
data\ca\57415\296304\3742481.html,Timberholm Inn,"""When Paul and I called the Timberholm and reserved two nights, we knew nothing about Stowe, VT, and very little about the inn. We were a few days into an impromptu vacation, and our only plan was to explore New England with as few plans as possible. The Timberholm was available, affordable, and seemed comfortable enough for a gamble.\n\nWe arrived at the inn later that day, and immediately thought: two days might not be enough. Located about half a mile off the main road on several acres of forest, the Timberholm is quiet and secluded, yet still close to all that Stowe has to offer. The lawns and flower gardens surrounding the house are inviting, well tended, and sprinkled with bird houses. Inside, the great room is full of warm woods, comfortable furniture, shelves of books, and a fireplace the size of my first apartment.\n\nHave you ever stayed at a B&B where the decor was so intricate and ornate that it felt like you were in a museum? You'd like to lie down, but you're afraid to disrupt the two dozen carefully arranged pillows on the bed. And don't even think about really settling down in the living room. Well, that's not the Timberholm. If you are looking for an immaculate room, Laura Ashley linens, and a Louis XIV bedstead, keep looking. We found something much better than that.\u00A0Whether we were on the porch sipping morning coffee and watching the woodpeckers squabble, or curled up with a book after a long hike, the Timberholm\u00A0is\u00A0the kind of place where we were truly able to make ourselves at home.\u00A0Rich and Darrik, the Inn's owners and proprietors, were not only attentive and eager to help, they were sincere. It was immediately clear that they were not simply doing their jobs: they were inviting us into their home, and they were glad to have us. That is a large part of why our two nights turned quickly into six.\n\nWhich brings me to breakfast. Let me tell you about breakfast. I usually skimp, or skip it altogether, but for that week it became my favorite part of the day. No buffet or warming trays here. Everything was made fresh and served as we sat down. Each meal started with fresh fruit: we had melon, cherries, or grapefruit, often served with vanilla yogurt or crunchy granola. This was usually followed by homemade scones, banana bread, or something similarly hot from the oven, and then a delicious quiche, fritatta, or other egg dish. Bacon or maple sausages on the side. One morning we had french toast stuffed with blackberries and cream cheese -- just fantastic. A great deal of their ingredients come from local Vermont farms or merchants: meats, cheeses, butter, cider, blended teas, etc. And they were more than happy to make\u00A0accommodations for vegetarians or those with dietary restrictions or allergies. The guests we met each morning were obviously enjoying themselves, and the breakfast conversation was livelier and easier than I expected. People were relaxed and enjoying themselves, that was clear. Several of the folks we met had stayed at the inn several times before.\n\nThe Timberholm has eight bedrooms, plus two multiple-room suites. The bedrooms came in a couple sizes and prices, ranging from $99 for a compact room and double bed, to $119 for a queen-sized bed in a larger room. We stayed in both, and while we found the larger room more comfortable, the compact room was cozy and functional. All rooms have private bathrooms with tubs or showers. In addition to the common living and dining rooms, there is a TV and game room in the basement, and an outdoor hot tub that must really hit the spot during ski season.\n\nWe hope to visit Vermont again soon, during the winter next time. We'll definitely be back at the Timberholm.\n",5,positive,"August 6, 2005",452 Cottage Club Rd,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4294

It is spotless, well-located, and I double-dog dare you not to fall in love with the city of Stowe. (Spoiler Alert: you will fall head over heels and there is nothing you can do about it.)\nThe rooms vary in size, so you can choose what fits your needs. There is a nice sitting area, a wonderful view, and the owners do all they can to make sure your stay is a pleasant one.\nI was extremely impressed with the breakfast. At some point in his life, Tom must have heard the phrase \""a way to a person's heart is through their stomach\"", and boy, did he take it to heart. I myself am often limited by my gluten-free dietary needs (which are not by choice, I assure you). Usually, this means that while everyone is enjoying a nice stack of pancakes or some delicious french toast, I get the gluten-free option... i.e. a plate of fruit. Now don't get me wrong, I love fruit, but it's hard not to feel like you are missing out when you can smell the maple syrup and gluten goodness everyone else is getting to enjoy. \nI am extremely happy to say that there was none of that at Timberholm. In fact, for the first time in I don't know how long, I got to have exactly what everyone else was having. If they got pancakes, I did too... gluten-free and delicious. If they got toast, you bet I got the gf version. That may seem small to some, but when you feel left out most of the time, it is amazing to find a place that takes that into consideration. Believe me when I tell you, it made all of the difference.\n\nAs for Stowe itself, if you haven't gone there yet, I highly recommend it. It has plenty of restaurant options, beautiful hiking and bicycling options, and nearby vineyards and distilleries. Oh, and did I mention that the Ben and Jerry's factory 20 minutes away?\n\nTrust me, this is a trip worth taking and I very much look forward to doing so again.",5,positive,"June 17, 2017",452 Cottage Club Rd,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4294

We stayed in the Americana room which had a faded charm, but was verging on tatty. The bathroom needed completely redoing from the stained toilet bowl to the mildewed shower curtain. We actually changed rooms halfway through (not because we were unhappy, the Inn was so busy that they needed to move us to be able to accommodate our dates \u2013 that was fine) and the second room that clearly had been redone was much, much nicer; clean, simple colours and not too much clutter.\n\nBut I am quite sure that Darrick and Rich are in the process of doing the work needed and it is a measure of their huge talent as hosts that a room that would have had us running for the hills anywhere else was here nothing more than a minor irritation. \n\nThey are hosts without equal. On the 1st night the sound of dripping water outside the window was irritating me. I mentioned this to Rich in passing and the next thing I know he\u2019s up a stepladder bunching towels under the drip to catch the water! They both know the local area very well and are extremely interesting to talk to. We spent hours with Rich chatting about local birds, moose, wolves and cooking. \n\nThe breakfasts are fantastic; varied, clever and extensive. The main living room is a great place for all the guests to meet and chat, we made it back every one of our five days for tea and cookies on the porch!

However if you have dietary restrictions he will gladly work with you and make something equally wonderful.  And whatever it is, it is from scratch and delicious.  Breakfast is served with coffee, a huge assortment of teas and juices, and always with cloth napkins.  Then every afternoon at 4pm Rich puts out a crock pot of homemade soup, usually with fresh baked bread or muffins to go with it.

After much research on the internet, we settled upon the Timberholm Inn as our lodging. What an inspired choice that turned out to be! We arrived on a friday afternoon. We walked in the front door and immediately were warmly greeted by the innkeeper Tom and his wonderful Golden Retriever Sophie. Tom checked us in(and upgraded us to a suite at no additional charge!), gave us a brief tour of the facilities(great room, dining room, lounge) and sent us on our way up to our room. Warm, engaging, but not overly \""in-your-face\"". As the stay went on, we learned that Tom was excellent at being helpful and accomodating, yet not overbearing. Our room was fantastic. A gorgeous view of the Vermont countryside, comfortable and clean, and an extremely comfortable bed. Small frig, microwave and tv all were in good working order. The bathroom was decent sized, appointed with everything you could need. Excellent water pressure in the shower. But as nice as the room was, the real star of the show at the Timberholm is the out-of-this-world breakfasts. Be prepared to loosen your belt and enjoy some of the best breakfasts you will ever have. Every morning was a three course meal, starting with some fresh fruit(melon, berries, apples), a pastry\u002Fbaked good of some sort(Tom's blueberry scones are the best I have ever had), and then a main dish. Oatmeal Pancakes, Sausage Quiche, Pumpkin Waffles...we were there 5 nights and every morning breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. And lest I forget, for my meat eating brethern....there was always Vermont maple sausage links or bacon on the table. I had heard that breakfasts can be lacking for some at b and b's. At the Timberholm, you will not go away hungry. Tom is very accomodating when it comes to guests with special needs as well. Another couple were vegetarians, so Tom was always sure to ask them if they wanted scrambled eggs or something else to replace meat. Our hosts, Tom and his wife Susan, were very helpful on suggesting restaurants and other things to do during our stay. Every place they suggested was a great experience. So, at this point, for those of you who have made it to the end of my review, you are probably wondering if there were any negative aspects to our stay. I can only think of one, and this is a very minor complaint. The inn's WIFI signal isn't real strong, so those of you who want to access the internet may need to do it from the Great Room. This wasn't a problem for me, because my GF and I loved sitting by the fireplace in the Great Room after a day of exploring, enjoying a cup of coffee or tea and the freshly baked cookies provided every afternoon and evening. All there is left to say in this review is thank you to Tom Barnes for helping to make our first visit to Vermont one to remember.

First. Nicole and I got married there. Linda and George were so accomadating and helpful that everything was perfect about it. Secondly, we got snowed in (2 ft of snow!) and Linda and George cooked all the guests an amazing spaghetti dinner!  That night we made new friends who are already planning a reunion for next year.  That was definantly above and beyond what we expected.  Thirdly, my vehicle got a flat tire.  Because of the storm it was very difficult to get help and things repaired.  George drove me to Burlington to get a special piece that I needed.  They helped me find phone numbers and even called people to help me out.  Because we we're basically stranded there, they let us stay an extra evening. Then the next day drove me to Montpelier with the tire to get it fixed.

The Inn is secluded and is quiet and peaceful unlike some others which are situated off the main road. It is about a 2-3 mile drive in either direction to get to everything you want to do. (I suggest Michael's on the Hill for a special evening...farm fresh ingredients!)\n\nAmbiance\nI would classify this as a \""romantic B&B\"". While the Inn is large by B&B standards it still remains quaint and cozy. The common areas are warm and inviting and the rooms are very well appointed with fireplaces in the bedrooms and bathrooms. The two person jetted tubs are a nice touch. A nice place to celebrate an anniversary, birthday, etc. I suggest a room with a view of the rear garden. We stayed in the Cotton Brooke and enjoyed it. One side note - for a larger Inn I was really struck by how quiet it was. There were lots of other couples but you would never know it. \n\nService\nGeorge and Linda run the Inn and it seems as if they do it all themselves. They are both attentitive, helpful and always asking you if things are to your liking. The homecooked breakfast in the mornings are a real treat. They offer a common kitchen area complete with water, sodas, coffee, etc. They are also quick to help you with any reservations, tips on activities, etc. They were a joy to spend time with.  \n\nI would highly recommend the Stone Hill Inn along with highly recommending VT as a vacation destination.

So what a wonderful relief and delight to discover an inn that carefully balances consistency of quality and offerings with a smaller, quieter, more personal experience. \n   The rooms at Stone Hill are decorated as though the owners themselves have to live in them, with excellent, elegant sheets, duvets, and towels. The furniture and wall art is lovely, comfortable, obviously chosen with care. The bed was comfortable enough that I never found myself looking forward to getting back to my own bed at home.

The minute we walked into the front door we felt as if we were being welcomed into their home.  The public areas are beautiful and perfect for guests to gather and share their days activities. Each evening we were served wine and delicious appetizers. It was a delightful way to unwind and then head out to dinner.  The stay includes breakfast which is a feast.  Linda is a marvelous cook and each morning we had our choice of several hot entrees along with pastries, juice and fruit.

The dinner reservations which were made for us were great and we'd definitely recommend eating at Gracie's. Our room and decor and facilities were perfect. We loved the fire in our room and the jacuzzi bath was so romantic. The gardens were beautiful too, the beds fabulously comfortable, our room was very quiet even though the inn was full of guests. We enjoyed borrowing a DVD from the extensive library and we had fun playing pool in the fully kitted out games room. The drinks and snacks kept coming as soon as we arrived, from sodas, water and wine, to choccies, cheese and popcorn. And we are still dreaming about Linda's banana bread! It was epic.

Pumpkin pancakes, creme br\u00FBl\u00E9e French toast, homemade granola, pear cake, cranberry muffins, coconut lime fruit salad, freshly squeezed fruit juice and the best bacon, eggs, cheesy hash brown...

I guess we should have seen the \""signs\""...payment up front, and the threat of a $500 penalty if we infringed any of the \""house rules\"", for which I had to sign agreement to. Then you begin to notice them...the miriad of little framed notices infoming you of what you can and cannot do, when you can do it, and when you cannot. They are in your room, bathroom, and every single room in the house, and when no rule exisits for a particular aspect, one is not too far away from being made! We (party of four) sat out on the patio at 10:00pm on a Friday evening of 75 degrees (no sign to say you could not) drinking a little wine with light convivial conversation..not for long though! The hostess arrived to inform us that \""they were not used to foursomes, sixsomes or eightsomes, and could we stop what we were doing because others were trying to sleep. \""We usually cater for only couples\"" something that was not elluded to when I made the reservations. I have to say the decor is first class, and so is the food. However, we all were left feeling very uncomfortable doing anything in the house, as one is watched very carefully. One poor guest lost the fob from his room key, and was asked to search his luggage\""in case it was in there\""!!! the fellow guest told us they felt very uncomfortable.

The second night we sat down the road at another patio\u002Fbar where we were made very welcome indeed, until our bedtime, as we did not enjoy being watched over. One other point to note.

They have 100s of DVDs to borrow to watch in your room and a large screen TV in case you want to watch movies on the big screen.\n\nYou can also take advantage of the toboggan and the good sized hill that are provided.  I took the toboggan for a run on the day we were checking out and it was a blast.   One of the inn employees even ran outside and down the hill to take pictures of me braving the hill.  Now that's service!\n\nWe stayed in the West Branch room and really enjoyed it.  Large King sized bed, soft comfortable sheets and pillows, great fireplace that we had on every time were in the room.  You can see the fireplace from the bedroom and bathroom which is a nice touch.  The bathroom was huge with a double sink and nice stand up shower.   There is also a jacuzzi tub and great robes for your use.  We liked the room's location which was at the end of the inn, very private.\n\nThe inn itself was very quiet during most times of the day which we liked.  Very relaxing and restful.  Maybe it was just the guests who happened to be there when we were, but everyone was so quiet.  You wouldn't know other people were staying at the inn if you didn't see folks in the breakfast room in the morning.  \n\nLinda made some great breakfasts and choices change daily.  There are typically two choices, and if neither appeal to you, they can always make you some eggs or omelets with toast and bacon.  And while you wait there is something yummy to start snacking on in the room that you can help yourself to.  If you have any food sensitivities, just let George and Linda know before you arrive and they will accommodate.  One of us is gluten free, and the innkeepers even put out some GF granola bars for us that we could help ourselves to during the day.\n\nGeorge and Linda hosted a happy\u002Fsocial hour on Saturday night and provided some nice hors d'oeuvres.  This was a great opportunity to unwind a little before dinner and get to know some of the other guests in the inn.  We met people from MA and also NC..yes, some people travel far each year to come to Stowe and the Stone Hill Inn...that shows how nice this place is.\n\nNote for skiiers - there are outdoor ski lockers next to the garages that you can take advantage of, at the same time keeping George and Linda happy by not tracking in a ton of snow :-)\n\nGeorge and Linda were great hosts and very accommodating. George has a great sense of humor and is very witty so we felt right at home and comfortable.   You can tell that both really enjoy what they do and it doesn't feel like work to them.  \n\nI would highly recommend this inn to anyone who is looking for all the great things Stowe has to offer, and want the privacy and relaxation of a small inn to get away from it all.  \n\nWe miss it already!",5,positive,"January 14, 2015",89 Houston Farm Rd,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4225

The room (as do all) had a two person hit tub, see-through gas fireplace, and a large post king bed. Their super-large bath towels and plush robes really gives the impression that the owners carefully thought through their approach to inn keeping. \n\nBreakfasts were fabulous (thanks Linda) with a pre-breakfast table normally covered with fresh fruit and cereals. Normally they had two main selections but would also customize orders if asked. George (whose background would not lead you to this conclusion) is friendly and engaging and with a sense of humor!!!!

The center village area of Stowe is just minutes away and another 20 minutes gets you into the town of Waterbury (to the south) with its award winning restaurants (Hen of the Woods is a must). Also close by is a pizzeria, several restaurants, and ski-oriented attractions.\n\nHere's a \""toast\"" to George ... disregard all this detail and just know that you are in for one heck of a memorable stay at this clean, warm, and convenient B&B.

The room felt very private and secluded and the view of the snow-clad garden outside the room door was gorgeous.\n\nThe gas fireplace in the room that sides into the bathroom adds to the romance and we really liked that we had a private bar fridge in the room to keep a few goodies in for when we wanted. There is also a guest kitchen area and I loved the personal touches here of delicious baked and packaged cookies to help yourself to, coffee, tea and hot chocolate as well as a fridge brimming full of soft drinks, bottled water and we especially loved the popcorn to pop yourself in the microwave.

I knew we needed a weekend away when HE suggested getting away without the kids!!  Hap & Amy Jordan, the Innkeepers, built their beautiful B&B a few years ago for couples who enjoy time alone in a relaxing atmosphere.  There are 9 guest rooms, each with it's own \""personality\"", but all have a king size bed that is equisite.  It was the best nights' sleep we ever had away from home!  The rooms also come with a Jacuzzi tub (rubber ducky included), fireplace that can be enjoyed from both the tub and the bed (it's built into the wall), and sliding doors that bring you out to the lush, colorful gardens that surround the Inn.  Our room was called The Notch and right outside we had a waterfall pond.  The Inn offers spa packages, so I took advantage of a massage.  We originally requested a couples massage, but only one masseuse was available as the date of our stay was during quiet season in Vermont.  Each night, Amy & Hap provide their guests with a complimentary appetizer and beverages (BYOB) between 5:00-6:30.  Hap prepares a delicious breakfast each morning.  The food is excellent!  There are plenty of benches and chaise lounges and even a hammock for you to relax in and do absolutely nothing.  There is a billiard table and games available in the large living room with a big, stone fireplace.  There are movies that can be taken to enjoy in your room (VHS, limited titles) along with some microwave popcorn (provided) that can be prepared in the Guest Pantry.  Coffee, tea, hot cocoa, soda, water, juice is available 24 hours a day.  Outside there is a hot tub and swings!  Stowe is a big ski area in the winter.  There are over 50 restaurants to enjoy.  There are way too many things to do in only a weekend.  We went for a horse-drawn carriage ride, a gondola ride up the highest mountain, shopping, a tour of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Factory, a tour of the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory, and right before returning to reality we walked through the Farmer's Market and spent whatever cash we had left!!

data\ca\57415\82683\398082433.html,Stone Hill Inn,"""Just stayed here this past weekend.  It was a weekend getaway for my wife and I for our anniversary.  We arrived late (after 10pm) on day of check-in because we drove up from PA.  When we arrived, we were greeted by Richard, who is the interim inkeeper along with his wife while George and Linda are on vacation.  Richard graciously greeted us and showed us to our room at the end of the hall.  We stayed in the West Branch room (more about that in a second).\n\nFirst impression is that the Inn is tastefully decorated, a bit modern with nice artwork on the walls.  The room was a nice size and had a mostly comfortable bed, a couple of nice soft armchairs and a HUGE bathroom with a 2 person jacuzzi, walk-in shower and double vanity.\n\nIn the morning, we slept in and got our coffee, which Richard informed us would be out by 7am but it was more like maybe 7:15 - no biggie.  We went for breakfast and were treated to a very nice breakfast with fresh fruit, yogurt, and local cider.  My wife had a waffle with salted caramel sauce on it which was like eating dessert.  I had the \""scramble\"" which was essentially smoked salmon, asparagus in scrambled eggs.  Pretty decent.   Richard and his wife Holly were very attentive making sure our coffee mugs were full and if we needed anything else.\n\nSo, the room nitpicks:  Bed was a little hard for my liking - I kind of expected a little softer (not mushy) bed.  Also, the room we were in was at the very end of the water pipes, so it took forever for any hot\u002Fcold water adjustments (the shower was difficult to keep a constant temp).  While the two-person jacuzzi tub was nice, I noticed that there were still some hairs left over from previous occupants.  Blech.  The tub wasn't dirty, just could have used a once-over by the cleaning person to ensure everything including stray hairs hadn't been left behind.  Also, the location of the room at the end, I think made the road noise coming from Route 108 a little more prevalent. \n\nThe rec-room was nice - although we didnt really use it.  Large with a big TV and pool table.  I assume that in the winter this room gets used more often.\n\nAs for the grounds - while this Inn is on 9 acres, most of it is wooded.  The rear of the property had some nice seating to enjoy the outdoors, and the front was nicely landscaped with various plants.  I did notice that they hadn't emptied their gutters in a while (weeds growing out of them) and their heating wires used to melt ice in the winter off the roof had come detached in one location...so a little grounds maintenance was probably needed.\n\nOverall, our experience was positive and while the nitpicks are just my personal observations, it doesn't meant this isn't a very nice place to stay, in a very central location in Stowe.  I probably would not stay here again not because of the quality or the nitpicks, but because there are many other places to try in the area, of equal or less cost (although you can't beat the privacy at Stone Hill during the summer.  There were only a few other couples staying when we were there).

A family member suggested VT, specifically this five star B&B based on a trip he had recently taken. \n\nFive stars? On two college students budgets? I was skeptical, but decided to investigate further....WOAH!! I was shocked at how affordable the rooms were! Especially when compared to similar lodgings in the area. \n\nI picked up the phone and was greeted by none other than the owner, Todd. I immediately recognized that Todd loved what he did. He was pleasant, informative, and genial. Best of all is he never once pressured me into booking my trip with him. By the end of the conversation I was sold and booked the Sterling Room for two nights. \n\n...make that one night...OH NO!! The day of check-in my friend informed me of a forgotten engagement she could not miss. We would have to cancel one of the nights on the day of. I picked up the phone and prepared to do battle to avoid a cancelation fee of some sort. Again, I got Todd, who upon hearing the news told me not to worry about it. \n\nWait, what? Seriously? This set the tone for the whole trip. His friendly flexibility took me completely by surprise and further excited me for the stay.\n\nThe following day we departed from Lowell and under three hours of driving later found ourselves in awe of nature. Rolling green hills cozy up to mist-veiled mountains and wood smoked air that hint at your stay before you even arrive. Beautiful.\n\nThe same can be said of the inn itself. I have stayed in a few B&B before and this was like none I had seen. The typical B&B looks like a home that's been converted to accommodate guests. Stone Hill Inn looks like a B&B that was converted to accommodate Todd and his family! It was modern without comprising the rustic charm of the area. I was smitten.\n\nWe walked into the lobby and were immediately greeted by Momma Rollins (super adorable) who proceeded to check us in and show us around. She showed us the pantry which included a stocked fridge, cutlery, dishes, and sweets baked fresh daily by Momma Rollins herself (mmmm chocolate scones *Homer Simpson-esq drool*)\n\nNext stop was the game room complete with pool table, big screen tv, a myriad of entertaining local knick-knackery, DVD library, board games, and Frank (you'll know if you go haha). There's even a brochure wall packed with pamphlets surveying the eclectic range of ways to best spend your time in Stowe. Everything from local day hikes and brewery tours to hot-air ballooning. Needless to say there is something for everyone in Stowe. \n\nThe final stop on the general tour was the breakfast\u002Fbanquet room. A long room with a high-vaulted ceiling and near-floor to ceiling windows provide ample space, vibrant natural light, and natural views for you to dine in. Our jolly guide points to a chalk-board detailing tomorrow's breakfast: from-scratch French toast with a berry drizzle and sausage :)\n\nIt was now time to view the room. As we entered the Sterling Room I recognized everything in the photos: King-sized bed, jacuzzi tub, large French sliding doors to the patio fire pit, master bathroom, and of course the double sided fireplace. But actually being in the room was something else entirely. \n\nRight after unpacking Todd appeared at our door to personally welcome us bringing with him nothing less than one of the Nations top rated craft beers from the Alchemist brewery located a stones throw away from the inn.\n\nThis started a lovely evening in which Todd personally took us to the Alchemist brewery and even ordered in a pizza for my friend and I. We played pool, chatted, watched jeopardy, and relaxed. I have never been so taken care of at a B&B before. The personal touches and hospitality made it feel like I was an old friend visiting rather than a patron.\n\nThe highlight of the night was during a private moment on the back patio. I had stepped out to savor the fresh VT air and was instantly treated to the crooning ballad of a distant wolf pack. It was all I could do to sing a verse with them. \n\nMoments like those are priceless to me. \n\nWe got a late start to our morning and slept through breakfast hours. Ever-accommodating, Todd was more than happy to prepare the meal for us anyways. You could taste the love\u002Fcare in every bite. \n\nIt was at this point I experienced the worst part of my stay...checkout. It felt as if I was parting from a dear friend. But the moment was bittersweet as we pulled away for I knew that I would be back. And I couldn't wait to do so. \n\n",5,positive,"March 13, 2017",89 Houston Farm Rd,Stowe,Vermont,05672-4225

Usual fireplace, bed, etc, but quieter than the last room we had as it is the last one down the hall.  \n   The inn itself looks from the outside like a small hotel - it is not a refurbished house, which we like as we are usually the hotel bound people, not the old house B&B guests.  The current inkeepers were pleasant and kind.  The breakfasts were wonderful.  Actually fantastic - I have an allergy and they specifically tailored some of the breakfast suggestions so I could enjoy them.  Huge kudos to them for that.\n   In the evening they would put out one dish that you could snack on, also nice if you were sitting in the living room or playing pool.  \n   Overall, I think the price is a little steep, but it is actually comparable to everything else around, so no biggie.  I would have preferred that the fireplaces were the real kind (vs electric), somewhat takes away from the feel of warming by the fire, especially in the main living room of the inn.  Also the showers are the standard plastic mold type, again would have expected real stone for the price of the rooms.  \nAll in all, both of our experiences here have been very pleasant.  We enjoy playing pool in the living room after a day on the slopes.  Last year when we were here and I was pregnant, they gave us snowshoes to walk the trails which was great as well.  Definitely a place we will return when we are in Stowe next year.\n\nFor restaurants:  If you are driving in from the NY area, I would highly recommend stopping over at Simon Pierce for dinner on the way.  We were driving Chrismas Eve, and had a wonderful dinner there.  Service was excellent.  In Stowe, I would definitely recommend Hen of the woods.  We visited the last time we were at Stowe and loved it, and the food is still great, as is the service and ambiance.  Michael's on the Hill had great food as well, but the restaurant is in a house, so the tables for the most part are laid out in an awkward way (this is only our opinion, we spoke with a few older couples who really liked the atmosphere).\n\nIf you would like a massage after a long day on the slopes, which we always do, I would suggest Top Notch.

We chose Vermont for a nice quiet romantic getaway and reprieve from the heat and humidity of the Gulf Coast. Stone Hill Inn is formally listed as a Bed and Breakfast, but that's really doing it a disservice. The beautiful property that the inn sits on is probably about 10 acres (?) of secluded peacefulness about 5 minutes outside of town, and the building itself is huge and spread out more like a hotel. There's a cool game\u002Fliving room with a 9 ft pool table and large (probably 65\""?) Smart TV with a Wii U and Blueray player. The bathroom in the room had a twin Jacuzzi (was the actual brand name) tub that sat in front of a gas fireplace, and the lights even had a dimmer switch (super romantic!). The room itself was spacious enough to accommodate the king-sized bed and actually still have plenty of room for people to walk around in (I hate when hotels cram a king-sized bed in a room that's the size of a closet, not like that here!). We stayed in the West Branch room, which was on the end of the hallway and very private with its own small patio area. Todd and Kristi made us feel right at home from the get go and provided us with a wealth of information on things to do and places to go in the surrounding area. The complimentary breakfast that Todd cooked every morning was very good and varied enough day to day to keep it interesting (the chicken and waffles were super tasty). They also heat up their maple syrup before bringing it to your table, which was a nice touch. Tony (the handyman, server, janitor, housekeeper, groundskeeper, and everything else it seemed) was super nice and bent over backwards to take care of anything we needed before we even knew we needed it.

We booked in for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute. The superb breakfast was more then satisfying. We also opted for the dinner each night prepared by Chef Eric,  The presentation each night was just excellent with high quality ingredients prepared by truly a Master Chef. \nThe surrounding area has many local boutiques,  golf courses and restaurants that make this area a great choice . We live in Western  Canada but hopefully we will return soon!,",5,positive,"June 24, 2018",795 chemin Alfred-Desrochers,Orford,Quebec,J1X 6J4

The hosts Christine and Eric are welcoming and will do whatever it takes to make you stay memorable.  They have several rooms and a suite at your disposal!!! Don't miss this little gem of a place. You will be fed like a king every morning. The coffee was the best! Treat yourself to a dinner without going anywhere....Chef Eric will be happy to cook  you a 4 or 5 course dinner and you bring your own wine. What a treat. My spouse and I were alone to partake that night so we had our own private Chef, you can't beat that!!! The bed was super comfy and the sheets, so soft......Everything you want to visit is within close distance. Ask Christine about what there is to see, she will be happy to help you or suggest attractions close by.  Do yourself a favor and book your next getaway here, you won't be disappointed! I know we'll be back!

Our room, Pomme de Rainette, was spacious, nicely decorated and with a view on the back garden and apple orchards. No bathtub but a super fancy shower with music and various jets. The owners, a friendly and welcoming French couple, made us feel at home. Eric, the chef, made us a lovely and French inspired 4 course meal which was ordered separately (taxes and service were added to our bill).  He also prepareda very filling and delicious breakfast with a lot of variety.  The food was a strong point!  You can walk the grounds of their extensive property yet you\u2019re only 10 \u002F15 minutes\u2019 drive from Orford and Magog. As a bonus, the clear starry sky at night ( away from the city lights) was amazing!! \nI would definitely recommend \uD83D\uDC4D",4,positive,"September 25, 2020",795 chemin Alfred-Desrochers,Orford,Quebec,J1X 6J4

When we arrived (late!), the Inn owners showed us to our room and informed us they upgraded our stay because we had booked the full week (and wanted to say \u201Cthank you\u201D!). What a lovely surprise. The room was charming and clean and spacious and we got a kick out of the space age shower! The breakfasts are beautifully presented and delicious, but even moreover, when I told them I didn\u2019t eat wheat flour, they went out and bought special bread to make the French toast the next day!! This level of care for the guest is pretty unheard of in today\u2019s world!\n\nLastly, the Inn is dog-friendly and the owners are very friendly to dogs! They took the time to point out how our dogs could enjoy the grounds and were clearly delighted to have dogs staying! They explained they lost their dog to old age last year. I loved that they got so much pleasure out of greeting furry-guests!\n\nEvery little detail was fabulous. I recommend this charming little Inn to anyone visiting the area.",5,positive,"October 21, 2020",795 chemin Alfred-Desrochers,Orford,Quebec,J1X 6J4
